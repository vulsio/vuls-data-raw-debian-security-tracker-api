	"id": "CVE-2013-2016",
	"description": "A flaw was found in the way qemu v1.3.0 and later (virtio-rng) validates addresses when guest accesses the config space of a virtio device. If the virtio device has zero/small sized config space, such as virtio-rng, a privileged guest user could use this flaw to access the matching host's qemu address space and thus increase their privileges on the host.",
