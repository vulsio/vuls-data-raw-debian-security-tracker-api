  "description": "The default configuration of Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR) Festival 1.95 beta (aka 2.0 beta) on Gentoo Linux, SUSE Linux, and possibly other distributions, is run locally with elevated privileges without requiring authentication, which allows local and remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the local daemon on port 1314, a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-0956.  NOTE: this issue is local in some environments, but remote on others.",
