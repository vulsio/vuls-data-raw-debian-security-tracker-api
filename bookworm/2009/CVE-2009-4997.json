	"id": "CVE-2009-4997",
	"description": "gnome-power-manager 2.27.92 does not properly implement the lock_on_suspend and lock_on_hibernate settings for locking the screen when the suspend or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action, a related issue to CVE-2010-2532.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression that followed a gnome-power-manager fix a few years earlier.",
