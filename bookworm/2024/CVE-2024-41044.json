	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ppp: reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed packets  Since 'ppp_async_encode()' assumes valid LCP packets (with code from 1 to 7 inclusive), add 'ppp_check_packet()' to ensure that LCP packet has an actual body beyond PPP_LCP header bytes, and reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed data otherwise.",
