	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling  Move the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() to mtk_remove().  Previously, if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe(), eth->dummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then call mtk_free_dev(), which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev was allocated (but it was not), potentially causing a NULL pointer dereference.  By moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove(), we ensure it's only called when mtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. This addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].",
