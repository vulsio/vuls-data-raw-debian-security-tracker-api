	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function, allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when unsanitized data is used.  The issue arises from improper sanitization in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources.  This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.",
