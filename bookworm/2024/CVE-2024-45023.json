	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow disk  read_balance() will avoid reading from slow disks as much as possible, however, if valid data only lands in slow disks, and a new normal disk is still in recovery, unrecovered data can be read:  raid1_read_request  read_balance   raid1_should_read_first   -> return false   choose_best_rdev   -> normal disk is not recovered, return -1   choose_bb_rdev   -> missing the checking of recovery, return the normal disk  -> read unrecovered data  Root cause is that the checking of recovery is missing in choose_bb_rdev(). Hence add such checking to fix the problem.  Also fix similar problem in choose_slow_rdev().",
