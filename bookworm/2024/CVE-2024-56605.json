	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: L2CAP: do not leave dangling sk pointer on error in l2cap_sock_create()  bt_sock_alloc() allocates the sk object and attaches it to the provided sock object. On error l2cap_sock_alloc() frees the sk object, but the dangling pointer is still attached to the sock object, which may create use-after-free in other code.",
