	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: list_lru: fix UAF for memory cgroup  The mem_cgroup_from_slab_obj() is supposed to be called under rcu lock or cgroup_mutex or others which could prevent returned memcg from being freed.  Fix it by adding missing rcu read lock.  Found by code inspection.  [songmuchun@bytedance.com: only grab rcu lock when necessary, per Vlastimil]   Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240801024603.1865-1-songmuchun@bytedance.com",
