	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  binfmt_elf_fdpic: fix AUXV size calculation when ELF_HWCAP2 is defined  create_elf_fdpic_tables() does not correctly account the space for the AUX vector when an architecture has ELF_HWCAP2 defined. Prior to the commit 10e29251be0e (\"binfmt_elf_fdpic: fix /proc/<pid>/auxv\") it resulted in the last entry of the AUX vector being set to zero, but with that change it results in a kernel BUG.  Fix that by adding one to the number of AUXV entries (nitems) when ELF_HWCAP2 is defined.",
