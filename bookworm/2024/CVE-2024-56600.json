	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: inet6: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in inet6_create()  sock_init_data() attaches the allocated sk pointer to the provided sock object. If inet6_create() fails later, the sk object is released, but the sock object retains the dangling sk pointer, which may cause use-after-free later.  Clear the sock sk pointer on error.",
