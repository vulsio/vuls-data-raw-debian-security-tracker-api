{
	"id": "CVE-2024-5642",
	"description": "CPython 3.9 and earlier doesn't disallow configuring an empty list (\"[]\") for SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() which is an invalid value for the underlying OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used (see CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due to NPN being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).",
