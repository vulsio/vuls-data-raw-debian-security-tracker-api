	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fbdev: efifb: Register sysfs groups through driver core  The driver core can register and cleanup sysfs groups already. Make use of that functionality to simplify the error handling and cleanup.  Also avoid a UAF race during unregistering where the sysctl attributes were usable after the info struct was freed.",
