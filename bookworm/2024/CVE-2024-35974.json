	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix q->blkg_list corruption during disk rebind  Multiple gendisk instances can allocated/added for single request queue in case of disk rebind. blkg may still stay in q->blkg_list when calling blkcg_init_disk() for rebind, then q->blkg_list becomes corrupted.  Fix the list corruption issue by:  - add blkg_init_queue() to initialize q->blkg_list & q->blkcg_mutex only - move calling blkg_init_queue() into blk_alloc_queue()  The list corruption should be started since commit f1c006f1c685 (\"blk-cgroup: synchronize pd_free_fn() from blkg_free_workfn() and blkcg_deactivate_policy()\") which delays removing blkg from q->blkg_list into blkg_free_workfn().",
