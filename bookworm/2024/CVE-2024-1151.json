	"description": "A vulnerability was reported in the Open vSwitch sub-component in the Linux Kernel. The flaw occurs when a recursive operation of code push recursively calls into the code block. The OVS module does not validate the stack depth, pushing too many frames and causing a stack overflow. As a result, this can lead to a crash or other related issues.",
