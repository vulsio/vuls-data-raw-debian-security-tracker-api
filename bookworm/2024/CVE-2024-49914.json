	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe  This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn20_program_pipe` function. The issue could occur when `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is not null before accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn20/dcn20_hwseq.c:1925 dcn20_program_pipe() error: we previously assumed 'pipe_ctx->plane_state' could be null (see line 1877)",
