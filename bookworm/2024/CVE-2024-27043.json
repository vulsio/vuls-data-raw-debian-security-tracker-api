	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free  In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed in several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL after dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places, for example, in the following call chain:  budget_register   |-> dvb_dmxdev_init         |-> dvb_register_device   |-> dvb_dmxdev_release         |-> dvb_unregister_device               |-> dvb_remove_device                     |-> dvb_device_put                           |-> kref_put  When calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.",
