	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: pressure: zpa2326: fix information leak in triggered buffer  The 'sample' local struct is used to push data to user space from a triggered buffer, but it has a hole between the temperature and the timestamp (u32 pressure, u16 temperature, GAP, u64 timestamp). This hole is never initialized.  Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.",
