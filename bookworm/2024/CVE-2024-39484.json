	"id": "CVE-2024-39484",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: davinci: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin  Using __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback being discarded with CONFIG_MMC_DAVINCI=y. When such a device gets unbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed without the cleanup being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix it by compiling in the remove callback unconditionally.  This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:  WARNING: modpost: drivers/mmc/host/davinci_mmc: section mismatch in reference: davinci_mmcsd_driver+0x10 (section: .data) -> davinci_mmcsd_remove (section: .exit.text)",
