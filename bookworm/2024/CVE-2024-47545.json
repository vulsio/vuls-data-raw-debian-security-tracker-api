	"id": "CVE-2024-47545",
	"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in qtdemux_parse_trak function within qtdemux.c. During the strf parsing case, the subtraction size -= 40 can lead to a negative integer overflow if it is less than 40. If this happens, the subsequent call to gst_buffer_fill will invoke memcpy with a large tocopy size, resulting in an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
