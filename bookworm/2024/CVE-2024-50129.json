	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: pse-pd: Fix out of bound for loop  Adjust the loop limit to prevent out-of-bounds access when iterating over PI structures. The loop should not reach the index pcdev->nr_lines since we allocate exactly pcdev->nr_lines number of PI structures. This fix ensures proper bounds are maintained during iterations.",
