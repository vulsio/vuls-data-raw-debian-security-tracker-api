	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ax25: Fix reference count leak issue of net_device  There is a reference count leak issue of the object \"net_device\" in ax25_dev_device_down(). When the ax25 device is shutting down, the ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device one or zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause memory leak.  In order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count of net_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.",
