	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: Add some bounds checking to firmware data  Smatch complains about \"head->full_size - head->header_size\" can underflow.  To some extent, we're always going to have to trust the firmware a bit.  However, it's easy enough to add a check for negatives, and let's add a upper bounds check as well.",
