	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix out-of-bounds write in trie_get_next_key()  trie_get_next_key() allocates a node stack with size trie->max_prefixlen, while it writes (trie->max_prefixlen + 1) nodes to the stack when it has full paths from the root to leaves. For example, consider a trie with max_prefixlen is 8, and the nodes with key 0x00/0, 0x00/1, 0x00/2, ... 0x00/8 inserted. Subsequent calls to trie_get_next_key with _key with .prefixlen = 8 make 9 nodes be written on the node stack with size 8.",
