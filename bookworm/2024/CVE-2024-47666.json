	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: pm80xx: Set phy->enable_completion only when we wait for it  pm8001_phy_control() populates the enable_completion pointer with a stack address, sends a PHY_LINK_RESET / PHY_HARD_RESET, waits 300 ms, and returns. The problem arises when a phy control response comes late.  After 300 ms the pm8001_phy_control() function returns and the passed enable_completion stack address is no longer valid. Late phy control response invokes complete() on a dangling enable_completion pointer which leads to a kernel crash.",
