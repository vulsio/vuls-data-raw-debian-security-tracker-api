	"id": "CVE-2024-49956",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: fix double destroy_workqueue error  When gfs2_fill_super() fails, destroy_workqueue() is called within gfs2_gl_hash_clear(), and the subsequent code path calls destroy_workqueue() on the same work queue again.  This issue can be fixed by setting the work queue pointer to NULL after the first destroy_workqueue() call and checking for a NULL pointer before attempting to destroy the work queue again.",
