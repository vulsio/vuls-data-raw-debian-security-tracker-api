	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: make sure exp active before svc_export_show  The function `e_show` was called with protection from RCU. This only ensures that `exp` will not be freed. Therefore, the reference count for `exp` can drop to zero, which will trigger a refcount use-after-free warning when `exp_get` is called. To resolve this issue, use `cache_get_rcu` to ensure that `exp` remains active.  ------------[ cut here ]------------ refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
