	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: ufs: core: Fix another deadlock during RTC update  If ufshcd_rtc_work calls ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() and the pm's usage_count is 0, we will enter the runtime suspend callback.  However, the runtime suspend callback will wait to flush ufshcd_rtc_work, causing a deadlock.  Replace ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() with ufshcd_rpm_put() to avoid the deadlock.",
