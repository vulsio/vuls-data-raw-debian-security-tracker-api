	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/amdgpu: Fix potential ioremap() memory leaks in amdgpu_device_init()  This ensures that the memory mapped by ioremap for adev->rmmio, is properly handled in amdgpu_device_init(). If the function exits early due to an error, the memory is unmapped. If the function completes successfully, the memory remains mapped.
