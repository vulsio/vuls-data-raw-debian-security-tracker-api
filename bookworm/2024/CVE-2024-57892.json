	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv  When mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a slab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to quota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the dangling pointer.  During the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never set as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option for remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the DQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the next quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the quota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.  To fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with read-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.  [akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]",
