	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease  It is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirming fl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict() tests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owner is an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This is wrong.  With this patch we restore the \"!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops\" case to behave as it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as the current code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.",
