	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: light: vcnl4035: fix information leak in triggered buffer  The 'buffer' local array is used to push data to userspace from a triggered buffer, but it does not set an initial value for the single data element, which is an u16 aligned to 8 bytes. That leaves at least 4 bytes uninitialized even after writing an integer value with regmap_read().  Initialize the array to zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.",
