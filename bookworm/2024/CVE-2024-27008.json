	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: nv04: Fix out of bounds access  When Output Resource (dcb->or) value is assigned in fabricate_dcb_output(), there may be out of bounds access to dac_users array in case dcb->or is zero because ffs(dcb->or) is used as index there. The 'or' argument of fabricate_dcb_output() must be interpreted as a number of bit to set, not value.  Utilize macros from 'enum nouveau_or' in calls instead of hardcoding.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
