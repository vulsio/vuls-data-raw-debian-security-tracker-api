	"id": "CVE-2024-50132",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing/probes: Fix MAX_TRACE_ARGS limit handling  When creating a trace_probe we would set nr_args prior to truncating the arguments to MAX_TRACE_ARGS. However, we would only initialize arguments up to the limit.  This caused invalid memory access when attempting to set up probes with more than 128 fetchargs.    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020   #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode   #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page   PGD 0 P4D 0   Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI   CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1769 Comm: cat Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #8   Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-1.fc39 04/01/2014   RIP: 0010:__set_print_fmt+0x134/0x330  Resolve the issue by applying the MAX_TRACE_ARGS limit earlier. Return an error when there are too many arguments instead of silently truncating.",
