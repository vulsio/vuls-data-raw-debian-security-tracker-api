	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: phy: dp83869: fix memory corruption when enabling fiber  When configuring the fiber port, the DP83869 PHY driver incorrectly calls linkmode_set_bit() with a bit mask (1 << 10) rather than a bit number (10). This corrupts some other memory location -- in case of arm64 the priv pointer in the same structure.  Since the advertising flags are updated from supported at the end of the function the incorrect line isn't needed at all and can be removed.",
