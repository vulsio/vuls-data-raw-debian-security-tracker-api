	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mana: Fix RX buf alloc_size alignment and atomic op panic  The MANA driver's RX buffer alloc_size is passed into napi_build_skb() to create SKB. skb_shinfo(skb) is located at the end of skb, and its alignment is affected by the alloc_size passed into napi_build_skb(). The size needs to be aligned properly for better performance and atomic operations. Otherwise, on ARM64 CPU, for certain MTU settings like 4000, atomic operations may panic on the skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref due to alignment fault.  To fix this bug, add proper alignment to the alloc_size calculation.
