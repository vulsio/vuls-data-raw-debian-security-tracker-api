	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy()  In mtk_crtc_create(), if the call to mbox_request_channel() fails then we set the \"mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan\" pointer to NULL.  In that situation, we do not call cmdq_pkt_create().  During the cleanup, we need to check if the \"mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan\" is NULL first before calling cmdq_pkt_destroy().  Calling cmdq_pkt_destroy() is unnecessary if we didn't call cmdq_pkt_create() and it will result in a NULL pointer dereference.",
