	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs: Fix ceph copy to cache on write-begin  At the end of netfs_unlock_read_folio() in which folios are marked appropriately for copying to the cache (either with by being marked dirty and having their private data set or by having PG_private_2 set) and then unlocked, the folio_queue struct has the entry pointing to the folio cleared.  This presents a problem for netfs_pgpriv2_write_to_the_cache(), which is used to write folios marked with PG_private_2 to the cache as it expects to be able to trawl the folio_queue list thereafter to find the relevant folios, leading to a hang.  Fix this by not clearing the folio_queue entry if we're going to do the deprecated copy-to-cache.  The clearance will be done instead as the folios are written to the cache.  This can be reproduced by starting cachefiles, mounting a ceph filesystem with \"-o fsc\" and writing to it.",
