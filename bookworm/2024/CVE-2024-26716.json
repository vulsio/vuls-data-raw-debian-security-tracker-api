	"id": "CVE-2024-26716",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state  Currently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub from udev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub. However, in case the actconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub would be NULL and upon further accessing to get port_dev would result in null pointer dereference.  Fix this by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.",
