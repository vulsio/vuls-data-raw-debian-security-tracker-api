	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Make use of cached 'epc_features' in pci_epf_test_core_init()  Instead of getting the epc_features from pci_epc_get_features() API, use the cached pci_epf_test::epc_features value to avoid the NULL check. Since the NULL check is already performed in pci_epf_test_bind(), having one more check in pci_epf_test_core_init() is redundant and it is not possible to hit the NULL pointer dereference.  Also with commit a01e7214bef9 (\"PCI: endpoint: Remove \"core_init_notifier\" flag\"), 'epc_features' got dereferenced without the NULL check, leading to the following false positive Smatch warning:    drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/pci-epf-test.c:784 pci_epf_test_core_init() error: we previously assumed 'epc_features' could be null (see line 747)  Thus, remove the redundant NULL check and also use the epc_features:: {msix_capable/msi_capable} flags directly to avoid local variables.
