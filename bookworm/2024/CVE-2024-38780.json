	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dma-buf/sw-sync: don't enable IRQ from sync_print_obj()  Since commit a6aa8fca4d79 (\"dma-buf/sw-sync: Reduce irqsave/irqrestore from known context\") by error replaced spin_unlock_irqrestore() with spin_unlock_irq() for both sync_debugfs_show() and sync_print_obj() despite sync_print_obj() is called from sync_debugfs_show(), lockdep complains inconsistent lock state warning.  Use plain spin_{lock,unlock}() for sync_print_obj(), for sync_debugfs_show() is already using spin_{lock,unlock}_irq().",
