	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix io_queue_proc modifying req->flags  With multiple poll entries __io_queue_proc() might be running in parallel with poll handlers and possibly task_work, we should not be carelessly modifying req->flags there. io_poll_double_prepare() handles a similar case with locking but it's much easier to move it into __io_arm_poll_handler().",
