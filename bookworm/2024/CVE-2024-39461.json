	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: bcm: rpi: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws  Commit f316cdff8d67 (\"clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by\") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data' with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in raspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed:    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4   index 3 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')  Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, which clears up the warning.",
