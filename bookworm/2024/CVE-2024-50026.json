	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: wd33c93: Don't use stale scsi_pointer value  A regression was introduced with commit dbb2da557a6a (\"scsi: wd33c93: Move the SCSI pointer to private command data\") which results in an oops in wd33c93_intr(). That commit added the scsi_pointer variable and initialized it from hostdata->connected. However, during selection, hostdata->connected is not yet valid. Fix this by getting the current scsi_pointer from hostdata->selecting.",
