	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  udf: Fix bogus checksum computation in udf_rename()  Syzbot reports uninitialized memory access in udf_rename() when updating checksum of '..' directory entry of a moved directory. This is indeed true as we pass on-stack diriter.fi to the udf_update_tag() and because that has only struct fileIdentDesc included in it and not the impUse or name fields, the checksumming function is going to checksum random stack contents beyond the end of the structure. This is actually harmless because the following udf_fiiter_write_fi() will recompute the checksum from on-disk buffers where everything is properly included. So all that is needed is just removing the bogus calculation.",
