	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode  calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or system) block groups, which can be allocated from unallocated disk space. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.  First, the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate one zone as one chunk, and no partial allocation of a zone. So, we should use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.  Second, the result \"avail\" may not be zone aligned. Since we always allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode, returning non-zone size aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim process.  This is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device. Allowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and end up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that.",
