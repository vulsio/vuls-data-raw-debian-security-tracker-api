	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usbnet: ipheth: do not stop RX on failing RX callback  RX callbacks can fail for multiple reasons:  * Payload too short * Payload formatted incorrecly (e.g. bad NCM framing) * Lack of memory  None of these should cause the driver to seize up.  Make such failures non-critical and continue processing further incoming URBs.",
