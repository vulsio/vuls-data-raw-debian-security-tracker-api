	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Fix userfaultfd_api to return EINVAL as expected  Currently if we request a feature that is not set in the Kernel config we fail silently and return all the available features.  However, the man page indicates we should return an EINVAL.  We need to fix this issue since we can end up with a Kernel warning should a program request the feature UFFD_FEATURE_WP_UNPOPULATED on a kernel with the config not set with this feature.
