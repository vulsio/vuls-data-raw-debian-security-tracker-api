	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: Fix missing release of 'active_io' for flush  submit_flushes  atomic_set(&mddev->flush_pending, 1);  rdev_for_each_rcu(rdev, mddev)   atomic_inc(&mddev->flush_pending);   bi->bi_end_io = md_end_flush   submit_bio(bi);                         /* flush io is done first */                         md_end_flush                          if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->flush_pending))                           percpu_ref_put(&mddev->active_io)                           -> active_io is not released   if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->flush_pending))   -> missing release of active_io  For consequence, mddev_suspend() will wait for 'active_io' to be zero forever.  Fix this problem by releasing 'active_io' in submit_flushes() if 'flush_pending' is decreased to zero.",
