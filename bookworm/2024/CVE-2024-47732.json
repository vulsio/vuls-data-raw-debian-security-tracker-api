	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: iaa - Fix potential use after free bug  The free_device_compression_mode(iaa_device, device_mode) function frees \"device_mode\" but it iss passed to iaa_compression_modes[i]->free() a few lines later resulting in a use after free.  The good news is that, so far as I can tell, nothing implements the ->free() function and the use after free happens in dead code.  But, with this fix, when something does implement it, we'll be ready.  :)",
