	"id": "CVE-2024-56682",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/riscv-aplic: Prevent crash when MSI domain is missing  If the APLIC driver is probed before the IMSIC driver, the parent MSI domain will be missing, which causes a NULL pointer dereference in msi_create_device_irq_domain().  Avoid this by deferring probe until the parent MSI domain is available. Use dev_err_probe() to avoid printing an error message when returning -EPROBE_DEFER.",
