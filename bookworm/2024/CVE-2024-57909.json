	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: light: bh1745: fix information leak in triggered buffer  The 'scan' local struct is used to push data to user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.  Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.",
