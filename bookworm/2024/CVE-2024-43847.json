	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix invalid memory access while processing fragmented packets  The monitor ring and the reo reinject ring share the same ring mask index. When the driver receives an interrupt for the reo reinject ring, the monitor ring is also processed, leading to invalid memory access. Since monitor support is not yet enabled in ath12k, the ring mask for the monitor ring should be removed.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.1.1-00209-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
