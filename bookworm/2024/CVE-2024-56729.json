	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: Initialize cfid->tcon before performing network ops  Avoid leaking a tcon ref when a lease break races with opening the cached directory. Processing the leak break might take a reference to the tcon in cached_dir_lease_break() and then fail to release the ref in cached_dir_offload_close, since cfid->tcon is still NULL.",
