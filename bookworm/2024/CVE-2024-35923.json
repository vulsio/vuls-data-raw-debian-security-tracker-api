	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: clear opcode specific data for an early failure  If failure happens before the opcode prep handler is called, ensure that we clear the opcode specific area of the request, which holds data specific to that request type. This prevents errors where opcode handlers either don't get to clear per-request private data since prep isn't even called.",
