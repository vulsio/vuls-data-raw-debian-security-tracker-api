	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Fix array out-of-bounds access  In order to use toshiba_dmi_quirks[] together with the standard DMI matching functions, it must be terminated by a empty entry.  Since this entry is missing, an array out-of-bounds access occurs every time the quirk list is processed.  Fix this by adding the terminating empty entry.",
