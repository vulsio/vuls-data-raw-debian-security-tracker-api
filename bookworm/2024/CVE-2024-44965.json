	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumption  Guenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11 that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then #DF from the stack guard.  It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on the start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. This is true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.  These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leading to a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has a short copy of the entry text?  Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignment assumptions.",
