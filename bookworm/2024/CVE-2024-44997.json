	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ethernet: mtk_wed: fix use-after-free panic in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb()  When there are multiple ap interfaces on one band and with WED on, turning the interface down will cause a kernel panic on MT798X.  Previously, cb_priv was freed in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() without marking NULL,and mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb() didn't check the value, too.  Assign NULL after free cb_priv in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block() and check NULL in mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb().  ---------- Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0072460bca32b4f5 Call trace:  mtk_wed_setup_tc_block_cb+0x4/0x38  0xffffffc0794084bc  tcf_block_playback_offloads+0x70/0x1e8  tcf_block_unbind+0x6c/0xc8 ... ---------",
