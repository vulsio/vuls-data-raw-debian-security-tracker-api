	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Fix possible memory leak in lpfc_rcv_padisc()  The call to lpfc_sli4_resume_rpi() in lpfc_rcv_padisc() may return an unsuccessful status.  In such cases, the elsiocb is not issued, the completion is not called, and thus the elsiocb resource is leaked.  Check return value after calling lpfc_sli4_resume_rpi() and conditionally release the elsiocb resource.",
