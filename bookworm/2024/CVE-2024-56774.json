	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: add a sanity check for btrfs root in btrfs_search_slot()  Syzbot reports a null-ptr-deref in btrfs_search_slot().  The reproducer is using rescue=ibadroots, and the extent tree root is corrupted thus the extent tree is NULL.  When scrub tries to search the extent tree to gather the needed extent info, btrfs_search_slot() doesn't check if the target root is NULL or not, resulting the null-ptr-deref.  Add sanity check for btrfs root before using it in btrfs_search_slot().",
