	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()  The following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt disabled section:  irq_set_vcpu_affinity()   irq_get_desc_lock()      raw_spin_lock_irqsave()   <--- Disable interrupts   its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()      guard(raw_spinlock_irq)   <--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard()   irq_put_desc_unlock()        <--- Warns because interrupts are enabled  This was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original raw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq).  Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock).  [ tglx: Massaged change log ]",
