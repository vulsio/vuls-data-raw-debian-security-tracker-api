	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/proc/task_mmu: prevent integer overflow in pagemap_scan_get_args()  The \"arg->vec_len\" variable is a u64 that comes from the user at the start of the function.  The \"arg->vec_len * sizeof(struct page_region))\" multiplication can lead to integer wrapping.  Use size_mul() to avoid that.  Also the size_add/mul() functions work on unsigned long so for 32bit systems we need to ensure that \"arg->vec_len\" fits in an unsigned long.",
