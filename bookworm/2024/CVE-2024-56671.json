	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: graniterapids: Fix vGPIO driver crash  Move setting irq_chip.name from probe() function to the initialization of \"irq_chip\" struct in order to fix vGPIO driver crash during bootup.  Crash was caused by unauthorized modification of irq_chip.name field where irq_chip struct was initialized as const.  This behavior is a consequence of suboptimal implementation of gpio_irq_chip_set_chip(), which should be changed to avoid casting away const qualifier.  Crash log: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0ba81c0 /#PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode /#PF: error_code(0x0003) - permissions violation CPU: 33 UID: 0 PID: 1075 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.12.0-rc6-00077-g2e1b3cc9d7f7 #1 Hardware name: Intel Corporation Kaseyville RP/Kaseyville RP, BIOS KVLDCRB1.PGS.0026.D73.2410081258 10/08/2024 RIP: 0010:gnr_gpio_probe+0x171/0x220 [gpio_graniterapids]",
