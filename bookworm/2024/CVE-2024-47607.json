	"id": "CVE-2024-47607",
	"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components.  stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the gst_opus_dec_parse_header function within `gstopusdec.c'. The pos array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If n_channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the pos array. The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This bug allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
