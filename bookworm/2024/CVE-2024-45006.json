	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: Fix Panther point NULL pointer deref at full-speed re-enumeration  re-enumerating full-speed devices after a failed address device command can trigger a NULL pointer dereference.  Full-speed devices may need to reconfigure the endpoint 0 Max Packet Size value during enumeration. Usb core calls usb_ep0_reinit() in this case, which ends up calling xhci_configure_endpoint().  On Panther point xHC the xhci_configure_endpoint() function will additionally check and reserve bandwidth in software. Other hosts do this in hardware  If xHC address device command fails then a new xhci_virt_device structure is allocated as part of re-enabling the slot, but the bandwidth table pointers are not set up properly here. This triggers the NULL pointer dereference the next time usb_ep0_reinit() is called and xhci_configure_endpoint() tries to check and reserve bandwidth  [46710.713538] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd [46710.713699] usb 3-1: Device not responding to setup address.
