	"id": "CVE-2024-31146",
	"description": "When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passed through to a guest, security of the entire system and of respective guests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowing internals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configuration cannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so far missing.  Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, but are not limited to - - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the   same page (4k on x86), - - INTx lines.",
