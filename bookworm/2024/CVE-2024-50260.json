	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sock_map: fix a NULL pointer dereference in sock_map_link_update_prog()  The following race condition could trigger a NULL pointer dereference:  sock_map_link_detach():\t\tsock_map_link_update_prog():    mutex_lock(&sockmap_mutex);    ...    sockmap_link->map = NULL;    mutex_unlock(&sockmap_mutex);    \t\t\t\t   mutex_lock(&sockmap_mutex); \t\t\t\t   ... \t\t\t\t   sock_map_prog_link_lookup(sockmap_link->map); \t\t\t\t   mutex_unlock(&sockmap_mutex);    <continue>  Fix it by adding a NULL pointer check. In this specific case, it makes no sense to update a link which is being released.",
