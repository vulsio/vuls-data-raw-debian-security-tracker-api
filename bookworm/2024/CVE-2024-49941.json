	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in gpiod_get_label()  In `gpiod_get_label()`, it is possible that `srcu_dereference_check()` may return a NULL pointer, leading to a scenario where `label->str` is accessed without verifying if `label` itself is NULL.  This patch adds a proper NULL check for `label` before accessing `label->str`. The check for `label->str != NULL` is removed because `label->str` can never be NULL if `label` is not NULL.  This fixes the issue where the label name was being printed as `(efault)` when dumping the sysfs GPIO file when `label == NULL`.",
