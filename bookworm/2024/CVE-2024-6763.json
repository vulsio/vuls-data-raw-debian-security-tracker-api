	"id": "CVE-2024-6763",
	"description": "Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.  The HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI  differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be  considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI  and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an  invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may  be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI  is used after passing validation checks.",
