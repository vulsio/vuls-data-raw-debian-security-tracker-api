	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets  For fragmented packets, ath12k reassembles each fragment as a normal packet and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMA direction should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Otherwise, an invalid payload may be reinjected into the HW and subsequently delivered to the host.  Given that arbitrary memory can be allocated to the skb buffer, knowledge about the data contained in the reinjected buffer is lacking. Consequently, thereâ€™s a risk of private information being leaked.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.1.1-00209-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
