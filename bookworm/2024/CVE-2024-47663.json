	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  staging: iio: frequency: ad9834: Validate frequency parameter value  In ad9834_write_frequency() clk_get_rate() can return 0. In such case ad9834_calc_freqreg() call will lead to division by zero. Checking 'if (fout > (clk_freq / 2))' doesn't protect in case of 'fout' is 0. ad9834_write_frequency() is called from ad9834_write(), where fout is taken from text buffer, which can contain any value.  Modify parameters checking.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
