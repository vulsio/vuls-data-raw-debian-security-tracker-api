	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: line6: Fix racy access to midibuf  There can be concurrent accesses to line6 midibuf from both the URB completion callback and the rawmidi API access.  This could be a cause of KMSAN warning triggered by syzkaller below (so put as reported-by here).  This patch protects the midibuf call of the former code path with a spinlock for avoiding the possible races.",
