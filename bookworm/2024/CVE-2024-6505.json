	"description": "A flaw was found in the virtio-net device in QEMU. When enabling the RSS feature on the virtio-net network card, the indirections_table data within RSS becomes controllable. Setting excessively large values may cause an index out-of-bounds issue, potentially resulting in heap overflow access. This flaw allows a privileged user in the guest to crash the QEMU process on the host.",
