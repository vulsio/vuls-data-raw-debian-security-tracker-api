	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ftrace: Fix regression with module command in stack_trace_filter  When executing the following command:      # echo \"write*:mod:ext3\" > /sys/kernel/tracing/stack_trace_filter  The current mod command causes a null pointer dereference. While commit 0f17976568b3f (\"ftrace: Fix regression with module command in stack_trace_filter\") has addressed part of the issue, it left a corner case unhandled, which still results in a kernel crash.",
