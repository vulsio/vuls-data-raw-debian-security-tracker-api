	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: RFCOMM: avoid leaving dangling sk pointer in rfcomm_sock_alloc()  bt_sock_alloc() attaches allocated sk object to the provided sock object. If rfcomm_dlc_alloc() fails, we release the sk object, but leave the dangling pointer in the sock object, which may cause use-after-free.  Fix this by swapping calls to bt_sock_alloc() and rfcomm_dlc_alloc().",
