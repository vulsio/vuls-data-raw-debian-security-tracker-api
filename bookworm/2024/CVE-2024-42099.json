	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/dasd: Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer  Fix invalid dereferencing of indirect CCW data pointer in dasd_eckd_dump_sense() that leads to a kernel panic in error cases.  When using indirect addressing for DASD CCWs (IDAW) the CCW CDA pointer does not contain the data address itself but a pointer to the IDAL. This needs to be translated from physical to virtual as well before using it.  This dereferencing is also used for dasd_page_cache and also fixed although it is very unlikely that this code path ever gets used.",
