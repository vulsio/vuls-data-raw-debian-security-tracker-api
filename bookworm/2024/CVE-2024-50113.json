	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firewire: core: fix invalid port index for parent device  In a commit 24b7f8e5cd65 (\"firewire: core: use helper functions for self ID sequence\"), the enumeration over self ID sequence was refactored with some helper functions with KUnit tests. These helper functions are guaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application includes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected to parent device.  This bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or more ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path to update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protection fault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.  This commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index.",
