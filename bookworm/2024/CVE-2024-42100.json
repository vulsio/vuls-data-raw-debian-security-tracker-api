	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common  In order to set the rate range of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls hw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are contained in a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in consequence, causes invalid pointer de-references.  Remove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates over the ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.",
