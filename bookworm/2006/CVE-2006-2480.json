  "id": "CVE-2006-2480",
  "description": "Format string vulnerability in Dia 0.94 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering errors or warnings, as demonstrated via format string specifiers in a .bmp filename.  NOTE: the original exploit was demonstrated through a command line argument, but there are other mechanisms for input that are automatically processed by Dia, such as a crafted .dia file.",
