	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as well  Various PV features (Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memory shared with hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we must properly teardown all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn't write to stale locations after we jump to the previously hibernated kernel (which can try to place anything there). For secondary CPUs the job is already done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do the same for boot CPU.",
