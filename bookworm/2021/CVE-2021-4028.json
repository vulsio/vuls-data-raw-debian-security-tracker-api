	"id": "CVE-2021-4028",
	"description": "A flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA communications manager listener code allowed an attacker with local access to setup a socket to listen on a high port allowing for a list element to be used after free. Given the ability to execute code, a local attacker could leverage this use-after-free to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges on the system.",
