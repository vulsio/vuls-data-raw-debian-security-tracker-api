	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/amd: Clear DMA ops when switching domain  Since commit 08a27c1c3ecf (\"iommu: Add support to change default domain of an iommu group\") a user can switch a device between IOMMU and direct DMA through sysfs. This doesn't work for AMD IOMMU at the moment because dev->dma_ops is not cleared when switching from a DMA to an identity IOMMU domain. The DMA layer thus attempts to use the dma-iommu ops on an identity domain, causing an oops:    # echo 0000:00:05.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/unbind   # echo identity > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:05.0/iommu_group/type   # echo 0000:00:05.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/bind    ...   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028    ...    Call Trace:     iommu_dma_alloc     e1000e_setup_tx_resources     e1000e_open  Since iommu_change_dev_def_domain() calls probe_finalize() again, clear the dma_ops there like Vt-d does.",
