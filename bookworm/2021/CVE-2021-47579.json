	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ovl: fix warning in ovl_create_real()  Syzbot triggered the following warning in ovl_workdir_create() -> ovl_create_real():  \tif (!err && WARN_ON(!newdentry->d_inode)) {  The reason is that the cgroup2 filesystem returns from mkdir without instantiating the new dentry.  Weird filesystems such as this will be rejected by overlayfs at a later stage during setup, but to prevent such a warning, call ovl_mkdir_real() directly from ovl_workdir_create() and reject this case early.",
