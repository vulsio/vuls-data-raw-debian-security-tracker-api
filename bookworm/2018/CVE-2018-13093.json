	"id": "CVE-2018-13093",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation.",
