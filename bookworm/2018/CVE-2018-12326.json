	"description": "Buffer overflow in redis-cli of Redis before 4.0.10 and 5.x before 5.0 RC3 allows an attacker to achieve code execution and escalate to higher privileges via a crafted command line. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common situations in which redis-cli is used with, for example, a -h (aka hostname) argument from an untrusted source.",
