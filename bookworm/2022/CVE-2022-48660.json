	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfully  When running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below command gpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25 There will be a warning trace as below: Call trace: free_irq+0x204/0x360 lineevent_free+0x64/0x70 gpio_ioctl+0x598/0x6a0 __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xb4/0x100 invoke_syscall+0x5c/0x130 ...... el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4 The reason of this issue is that calling request_threaded_irq() function failed, and then lineevent_free() is invoked to release the resource. Since the lineevent_state::irq was already set, so the subsequent invocation of free_irq() would trigger the above warning call trace. To fix this issue, set the lineevent_state::irq after the IRQ register successfully.",
