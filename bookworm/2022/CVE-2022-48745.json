	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Use del_timer_sync in fw reset flow of halting poll  Substitute del_timer() with del_timer_sync() in fw reset polling deactivation flow, in order to prevent a race condition which occurs when del_timer() is called and timer is deactivated while another process is handling the timer interrupt. A situation that led to the following call trace: \tRIP: 0010:run_timer_softirq+0x137/0x420 \t<IRQ> \trecalibrate_cpu_khz+0x10/0x10 \tktime_get+0x3e/0xa0 \t? sched_clock_cpu+0xb/0xc0 \t__do_softirq+0xf5/0x2ea \tirq_exit_rcu+0xc1/0xf0 \tsysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x9e/0xc0 \tasm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x12/0x20 \t</IRQ>",
