	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/radeon: add a force flush to delay work when radeon  Although radeon card fence and wait for gpu to finish processing current batch rings, there is still a corner case that radeon lockup work queue may not be fully flushed, and meanwhile the radeon_suspend_kms() function has called pci_set_power_state() to put device in D3hot state. Per PCI spec rev 4.0 on 5.3.1.4.1 D3hot State. > Configuration and Message requests are the only TLPs accepted by a Function in > the D3hot state.
