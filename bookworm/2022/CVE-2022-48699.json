	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/debug: fix dentry leak in update_sched_domain_debugfs  Kuyo reports that the pattern of using debugfs_remove(debugfs_lookup()) leaks a dentry and with a hotplug stress test, the machine eventually runs out of memory.  Fix this up by using the newly created debugfs_lookup_and_remove() call instead which properly handles the dentry reference counting logic.",
