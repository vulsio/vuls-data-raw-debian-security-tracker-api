	"id": "CVE-2022-46337",
	"description": "A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks. In  LDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill  up the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated  Derby installations, this could also allow the attacker to execute  malware which was visible to and executable by the account which booted  the Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also  protected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability could  also let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive  database functions and procedures.  Mitigation:  Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0.  Alternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions should  build their own Derby distribution from one of the release families to  which the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the  releases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11,  and 8.",
