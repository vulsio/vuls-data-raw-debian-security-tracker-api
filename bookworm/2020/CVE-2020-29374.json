	"id": "CVE-2020-29374",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.",
