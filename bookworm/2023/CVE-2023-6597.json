	"description": "An issue was found in the CPython `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class affecting versions 3.12.2, 3.11.8, 3.10.13, 3.9.18, and 3.8.18 and prior.  The tempfile.TemporaryDirectory class would dereference symlinks during cleanup of permissions-related errors. This means users which can run privileged programs are potentially able to modify permissions of files referenced by symlinks in some circumstances.",
