	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix memory leak of LZMA global compressed deduplication  When stressing microLZMA EROFS images with the new global compressed deduplication feature enabled (`-Ededupe`), I found some short-lived temporary pages weren't properly released, which could slowly cause unexpected OOMs hours later.  Let's fix it now (LZ4 and DEFLATE don't have this issue.)",
