	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nbd: fix uaf in nbd_open  Commit 4af5f2e03013 (\"nbd: use blk_mq_alloc_disk and blk_cleanup_disk\") cleans up disk by blk_cleanup_disk() and it won't set disk->private_data as NULL as before. UAF may be triggered in nbd_open() if someone tries to open nbd device right after nbd_put() since nbd has been free in nbd_dev_remove().  Fix this by implementing ->free_disk and free private data in it.",
