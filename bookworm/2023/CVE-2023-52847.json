	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: bttv: fix use after free error due to btv->timeout timer  There may be some a race condition between timer function bttv_irq_timeout and bttv_remove. The timer is setup in probe and there is no timer_delete operation in remove function. When it hit kfree btv, the function might still be invoked, which will cause use after free bug.  This bug is found by static analysis, it may be false positive.  Fix it by adding del_timer_sync invoking to the remove function.  cpu0                cpu1                   bttv_probe                     ->timer_setup                       ->bttv_set_dma                         ->mod_timer; bttv_remove   ->kfree(btv);                   ->bttv_irq_timeout                     ->USE btv",
