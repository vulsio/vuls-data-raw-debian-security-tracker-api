	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv4: fix null-deref in ipv4_link_failure  Currently, we assume the skb is associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if it is re-routed by ipvs. When skb->dev is NULL, dev_net(skb->dev) will become null-dereference. This patch adds a check for the edge case and switch to use the net_device from the rtable when skb->dev is NULL.",
