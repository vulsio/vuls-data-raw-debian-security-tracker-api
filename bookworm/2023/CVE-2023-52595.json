	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rt2x00: restart beacon queue when hardware reset  When a hardware reset is triggered, all registers are reset, so all queues are forced to stop in hardware interface. However, mac80211 will not automatically stop the queue. If we don't manually stop the beacon queue, the queue will be deadlocked and unable to start again. This patch fixes the issue where Apple devices cannot connect to the AP after calling ieee80211_restart_hw().",
