	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete  syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from the powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message completes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not exist anymore and hence the bug.  Use usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon device disconnection.  [1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=0434ac83f907a1dbdd1e",
