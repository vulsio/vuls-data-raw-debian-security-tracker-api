	"description": "A flaw was found in Squid. The limits applied for validation of HTTP response headers are applied before caching. However, Squid may grow a cached HTTP response header beyond the configured maximum size, causing a stall or crash of the worker process when a large header is retrieved from the disk cache, resulting in a denial of service.",
