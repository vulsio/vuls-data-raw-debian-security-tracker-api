	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: can: j1939: enhanced error handling for tightly received RTS messages in xtp_rx_rts_session_new  This patch enhances error handling in scenarios with RTS (Request to Send) messages arriving closely. It replaces the less informative WARN_ON_ONCE backtraces with a new error handling method. This provides clearer error messages and allows for the early termination of problematic sessions. Previously, sessions were only released at the end of j1939_xtp_rx_rts().  Potentially this could be reproduced with something like: testj1939 -r vcan0:0x80 & while true; do \t# send first RTS \tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301; \t# send second RTS \tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301; \t# send abort \tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#ff00000000002301; done",
