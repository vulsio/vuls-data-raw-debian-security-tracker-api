	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: Fix double free in hci_conn_cleanup  syzbot reports a slab use-after-free in hci_conn_hash_flush [1]. After releasing an object using hci_conn_del_sysfs in the hci_conn_cleanup function, releasing the same object again using the hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put functions causes a double free. Here's a simplified flow:  hci_conn_del_sysfs:   hci_dev_put     put_device       kobject_put         kref_put           kobject_release             kobject_cleanup               kfree_const                 kfree(name)  hci_dev_put:   ...     kfree(name)  hci_conn_put:   put_device     ...       kfree(name)  This patch drop the hci_dev_put and hci_conn_put function call in hci_conn_cleanup function, because the object is freed in hci_conn_del_sysfs function.  This patch also fixes the refcounting in hci_conn_add_sysfs() and hci_conn_del_sysfs() to take into account device_add() failures.  This fixes CVE-2023-28464.",
