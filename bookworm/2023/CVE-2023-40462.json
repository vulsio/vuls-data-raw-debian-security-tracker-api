	"description": "The ACEManager component of ALEOS 4.16 and earlier does not    perform input sanitization during authentication, which could    potentially result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for    ACEManager without impairing other router functions. ACEManager    recovers from the DoS condition by restarting within ten seconds of    becoming unavailable.",
