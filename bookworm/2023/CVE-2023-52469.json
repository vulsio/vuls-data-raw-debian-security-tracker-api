	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table  When ps allocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table frees adev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control flow goes through the following call chains:  kv_parse_power_table   |-> kv_dpm_init         |-> kv_dpm_sw_init \t      |-> kv_dpm_fini  The adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its first free in kv_parse_power_table and causes a use-after-free bug.",
