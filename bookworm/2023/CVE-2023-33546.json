	"description": "Janino 3.1.9 and earlier are subject to denial of service (DOS) attacks when using the expression evaluator.guess parameter name method. If the parser runs on user-supplied input, an attacker could supply content that causes the parser to crash due to a stack overflow. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because Janino is not intended for use with untrusted input.",
