	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run  In mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.  In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in mtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while mark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.  There are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove the module, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup. The possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a use-after-free bug.  CPU0                  CPU1 mtk_jpeg_dec_...    |   start worker\t    |                     |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work mtk_jpeg_remove     |   v4l2_m2m_release  |     kfree(m2m_dev); |                     |                     | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv                     |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use  If we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release, it will have a similar sequence.  Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker successfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.",
