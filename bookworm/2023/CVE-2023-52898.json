	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xhci: Fix null pointer dereference when host dies  Make sure xhci_free_dev() and xhci_kill_endpoint_urbs() do not race and cause null pointer dereference when host suddenly dies.  Usb core may call xhci_free_dev() which frees the xhci->devs[slot_id] virt device at the same time that xhci_kill_endpoint_urbs() tries to loop through all the device's endpoints, checking if there are any cancelled urbs left to give back.  hold the xhci spinlock while freeing the virt device",
