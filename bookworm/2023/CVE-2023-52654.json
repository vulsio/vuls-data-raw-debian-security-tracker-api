	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/af_unix: disable sending io_uring over sockets  File reference cycles have caused lots of problems for io_uring in the past, and it still doesn't work exactly right and races with unix_stream_read_generic(). The safest fix would be to completely disallow sending io_uring files via sockets via SCM_RIGHT, so there are no possible cycles invloving registered files and thus rendering SCM accounting on the io_uring side unnecessary.",
