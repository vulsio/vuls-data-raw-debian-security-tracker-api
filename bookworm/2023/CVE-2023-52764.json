	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: gspca: cpia1: shift-out-of-bounds in set_flicker  Syzkaller reported the following issue: UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/media/usb/gspca/cpia1.c:1031:27 shift exponent 245 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'  When the value of the variable \"sd->params.exposure.gain\" exceeds the number of bits in an integer, a shift-out-of-bounds error is reported. It is triggered because the variable \"currentexp\" cannot be left-shifted by more than the number of bits in an integer. In order to avoid invalid range during left-shift, the conditional expression is added.",
