This vulnerability arises when  TLS Session Tickets https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_ticket_key  are used and/or the  SSL session cache https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_cache  are used in the default server and the default server is performing client certificate authentication.    Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.",
