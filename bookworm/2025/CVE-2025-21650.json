	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: hns3: fixed hclge_fetch_pf_reg accesses bar space out of bounds issue  The TQP BAR space is divided into two segments. TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs 1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However, hclge_fetch_pf_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when reading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater than 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs. The problem of different segments has been considered during the initialization of tqp.io_base. Therefore, tqp.io_base is directly used when the queue is read in hclge_fetch_pf_reg.  The error message:  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff800037200000 pc : hclge_fetch_pf_reg+0x138/0x250 [hclge] lr : hclge_get_regs+0x84/0x1d0 [hclge] Call trace:  hclge_fetch_pf_reg+0x138/0x250 [hclge]  hclge_get_regs+0x84/0x1d0 [hclge]  hns3_get_regs+0x2c/0x50 [hns3]  ethtool_get_regs+0xf4/0x270  dev_ethtool+0x674/0x8a0  dev_ioctl+0x270/0x36c  sock_do_ioctl+0x110/0x2a0  sock_ioctl+0x2ac/0x530  __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xa8/0x100  invoke_syscall+0x4c/0x124  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x140/0x15c  do_el0_svc+0x30/0xd0  el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c  el0_sync_handler+0xb0/0xb4  el0_sync+0x168/0x180",
