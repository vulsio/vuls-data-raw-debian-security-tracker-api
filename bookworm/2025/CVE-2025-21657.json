	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched_ext: Replace rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass()  scx_ops_bypass() iterates all CPUs to re-enqueue all the scx tasks. For each CPU, it acquires a lock using rq_lock() regardless of whether a CPU is offline or the CPU is currently running a task in a higher scheduler class (e.g., deadline). The rq_lock() is supposed to be used for online CPUs, and the use of rq_lock() may trigger an unnecessary warning in rq_pin_lock(). Therefore, replace rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass().  Without this change, we observe the following warning:  ===== START ===== [    6.615205] rq->balance_callback && rq->balance_callback != &balance_push_callback [    6.615208] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/sched.h:1730 __schedule+0x1130/0x1c90 =====  END  =====",
