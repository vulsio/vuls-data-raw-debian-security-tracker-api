	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets  The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly: It prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, \"mptcp\", 6); from working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).  But in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk. In such case, sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.  This will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn mptcp socket:  BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in subflow_data_ready+0x181/0x2b0 Call Trace:  tcp_data_ready+0xf8/0x370  [..]",
