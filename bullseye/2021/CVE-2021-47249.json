	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: rds: fix memory leak in rds_recvmsg  Syzbot reported memory leak in rds. The problem was in unputted refcount in case of error.  int rds_recvmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t size, \t\tint msg_flags) { ...  \tif (!rds_next_incoming(rs, &inc)) { \t\t... \t}  After this \"if\" inc refcount incremented and  \tif (rds_cmsg_recv(inc, msg, rs)) { \t\tret = -EFAULT; \t\tgoto out; \t} ... out: \treturn ret; }  in case of rds_cmsg_recv() fail the refcount won't be decremented. And it's easy to see from ftrace log, that rds_inc_addref() don't have rds_inc_put() pair in rds_recvmsg() after rds_cmsg_recv()   1)               |  rds_recvmsg() {  1)   3.721 us    |    rds_inc_addref();  1)   3.853 us    |    rds_message_inc_copy_to_user();  1) + 10.395 us   |    rds_cmsg_recv();  1) + 34.260 us   |  }",
