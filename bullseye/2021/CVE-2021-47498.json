	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm rq: don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend  DM uses blk-mq's quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue.  But blk-mq's unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevator switch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during suspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.  Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests and dm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.",
