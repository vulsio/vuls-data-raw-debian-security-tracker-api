	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails  When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(), h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htable pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed hashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called on it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.  Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid empty hashtab when the allocation fails.",
