	"id": "CVE-2021-47153",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: i801: Don't generate an interrupt on bus reset  Now that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bit in a attempt to recover from a timed out transaction triggers an interrupt. Unfortunately, the interrupt handler (i801_isr) is not prepared for this situation and will try to process the interrupt as if it was signaling the end of a successful transaction. In the case of a block transaction, this can result in an out-of-range memory access.  This condition was reproduced several times by syzbot: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=ed71512d469895b5b34e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=8c8dedc0ba9e03f6c79e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=c8ff0b6d6c73d81b610e https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=33f6c360821c399d69eb https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=be15dc0b1933f04b043a https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=b4d3fd1dfd53e90afd79  So disable interrupts while trying to reset the bus. Interrupts will be enabled again for the following transaction.",
