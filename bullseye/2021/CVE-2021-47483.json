	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regmap: Fix possible double-free in regcache_rbtree_exit()  In regcache_rbtree_insert_to_block(), when 'present' realloc failed, the 'blk' which is supposed to assign to 'rbnode->block' will be freed, so 'rbnode->block' points a freed memory, in the error handling path of regcache_rbtree_init(), 'rbnode->block' will be freed again in regcache_rbtree_exit(), KASAN will report double-free as follows:  BUG: KASAN: double-free or invalid-free in kfree+0xce/0x390 Call Trace:  slab_free_freelist_hook+0x10d/0x240  kfree+0xce/0x390  regcache_rbtree_exit+0x15d/0x1a0  regcache_rbtree_init+0x224/0x2c0  regcache_init+0x88d/0x1310  __regmap_init+0x3151/0x4a80  __devm_regmap_init+0x7d/0x100  madera_spi_probe+0x10f/0x333 [madera_spi]  spi_probe+0x183/0x210  really_probe+0x285/0xc30  To fix this, moving up the assignment of rbnode->block to immediately after the reallocation has succeeded so that the data structure stays valid even if the second reallocation fails.",
