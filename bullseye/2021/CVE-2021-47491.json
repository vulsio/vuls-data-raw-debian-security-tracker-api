	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special files  The read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files opened readonly and mapped with VM_EXEC.  The intended usecase is to avoid TLB misses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types so a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block device, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This may cause bugs, like [1] and [2].  This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for regular files in order to close the attack surface.
