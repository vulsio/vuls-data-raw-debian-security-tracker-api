	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  batman-adv: Avoid WARN_ON timing related checks  The soft/batadv interface for a queued OGM can be changed during the time the OGM was queued for transmission and when the OGM is actually transmitted by the worker.  But WARN_ON must be used to denote kernel bugs and not to print simple warnings. A warning can simply be printed using pr_warn.",
