	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/a3xx: fix error handling in a3xx_gpu_init()  These error paths returned 1 on failure, instead of a negative error code.  This would lead to an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is that the check for \"if (ret != -ENODATA)\" did not work because \"ret\" was set to 1.",
