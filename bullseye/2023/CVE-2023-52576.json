	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm, kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from ima_free_kexec_buffer()  The code calling ima_free_kexec_buffer() runs long after the memblock allocator has already been torn down, potentially resulting in a use after free in memblock_isolate_range().  With KASAN or KFENCE, this use after free will result in a BUG from the idle task, and a subsequent kernel panic.  Switch ima_free_kexec_buffer() over to memblock_free_late() to avoid that bug.",
