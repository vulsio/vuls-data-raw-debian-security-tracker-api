	"id": "CVE-2023-46836",
	"description": "The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative Return Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe.  It was believed that the mitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.  However, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left interrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one conditionally on whether XPTI was active.  As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations are not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race condition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections and launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.",
