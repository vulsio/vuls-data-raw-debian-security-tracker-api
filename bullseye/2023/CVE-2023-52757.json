	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix potential deadlock when releasing mids  All release_mid() callers seem to hold a reference of @mid so there is no need to call kref_put(&mid->refcount, __release_mid) under @server->mid_lock spinlock.  If they don't, then an use-after-free bug would have occurred anyways.  By getting rid of such spinlock also fixes a potential deadlock as shown below  CPU 0                                CPU 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------ cifs_demultiplex_thread()            cifs_debug_data_proc_show()  release_mid()   spin_lock(&server->mid_lock);                                      spin_lock(&cifs_tcp_ses_lock) \t\t\t\t      spin_lock(&server->mid_lock)   __release_mid()    smb2_find_smb_tcon()     spin_lock(&cifs_tcp_ses_lock) *deadlock*",
