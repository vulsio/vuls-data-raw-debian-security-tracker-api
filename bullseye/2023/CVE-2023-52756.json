	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pwm: Fix double shift bug  These enums are passed to set/test_bit().  The set/test_bit() functions take a bit number instead of a shifted value.  Passing a shifted value is a double shift bug like doing BIT(BIT(1)).  The double shift bug doesn't cause a problem here because we are only checking 0 and 1 but if the value was 5 or above then it can lead to a buffer overflow.",
