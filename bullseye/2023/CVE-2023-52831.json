	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpu/hotplug: Don't offline the last non-isolated CPU  If a system has isolated CPUs via the \"isolcpus=\" command line parameter, then an attempt to offline the last housekeeping CPU will result in a WARN_ON() when rebuilding the scheduler domains and a subsequent panic due to and unhandled empty CPU mas in partition_sched_domains_locked().  cpuset_hotplug_workfn()   rebuild_sched_domains_locked()     ndoms = generate_sched_domains(&doms, &attr);       cpumask_and(doms[0], top_cpuset.effective_cpus, housekeeping_cpumask(HK_FLAG_DOMAIN));  Thus results in an empty CPU mask which triggers the warning and then the subsequent crash:  WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 80 at kernel/sched/topology.c:2366 build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408 Call trace:  build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408  partition_sched_domains_locked+0x234/0x880  rebuild_sched_domains_locked+0x37c/0x798  rebuild_sched_domains+0x30/0x58  cpuset_hotplug_workfn+0x2a8/0x930  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffe80027ab37080  partition_sched_domains_locked+0x318/0x880  rebuild_sched_domains_locked+0x37c/0x798  Aside of the resulting crash, it does not make any sense to offline the last last housekeeping CPU.  Prevent this by masking out the non-housekeeping CPUs when selecting a target CPU for initiating the CPU unplug operation via the work queue.",
