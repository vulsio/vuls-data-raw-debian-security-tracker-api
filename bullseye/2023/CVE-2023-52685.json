	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pstore: ram_core: fix possible overflow in persistent_ram_init_ecc()  In persistent_ram_init_ecc(), on 64-bit arches DIV_ROUND_UP() will return 64-bit value since persistent_ram_zone::buffer_size has type size_t which is derived from the 64-bit *unsigned long*, while the ecc_blocks variable this value gets assigned to has (always 32-bit) *int* type.  Even if that value fits into *int* type, an overflow is still possible when calculating the size_t typed ecc_total variable further below since there's no cast to any 64-bit type before multiplication.  Declaring the ecc_blocks variable as *size_t* should fix this mess...  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static analysis tool.",
