	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Fix slab-use-after-free in gfs2_qd_dealloc  In gfs2_put_super(), whether withdrawn or not, the quota should be cleaned up by gfs2_quota_cleanup().  Otherwise, struct gfs2_sbd will be freed before gfs2_qd_dealloc (rcu callback) has run for all gfs2_quota_data objects, resulting in use-after-free.  Also, gfs2_destroy_threads() and gfs2_quota_cleanup() is already called by gfs2_make_fs_ro(), so in gfs2_put_super(), after calling gfs2_make_fs_ro(), there is no need to call them again.",
