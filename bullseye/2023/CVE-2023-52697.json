	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_common: ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL  sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() are used by different codecs, and some of them use the same dai name. For example, rt712 and rt713 both use \"rt712-sdca-aif1\" and sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit(). As a result, sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() will be called twice by mc_dailink_exit_loop(). Set ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL; after put_device(ctx->headset_codec_dev); to avoid ctx->headset_codec_dev being put twice.",
