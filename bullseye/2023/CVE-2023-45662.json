	"id": "CVE-2023-45662",
	"description": "stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images. When `stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load` is set to `TRUE` and `req_comp` is set to a number that doesn’t match the real number of components per pixel, the library attempts to flip the image vertically. A crafted image file can trigger `memcpy` out-of-bounds read because `bytes_per_pixel` used to calculate `bytes_per_row` doesn’t match the real image array dimensions.",
