	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: amd: Fix memory leak in amd_sof_acp_probe()  Driver uses kasprintf() to initialize fw_{code,data}_bin members of struct acp_dev_data, but kfree() is never called to deallocate the memory, which results in a memory leak.  Fix the issue by switching to devm_kasprintf(). Additionally, ensure the allocation was successful by checking the pointer validity.",
