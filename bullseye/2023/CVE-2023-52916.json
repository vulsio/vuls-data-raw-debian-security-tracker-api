	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: aspeed: Fix memory overwrite if timing is 1600x900  When capturing 1600x900, system could crash when system memory usage is tight.  The way to reproduce this issue: 1. Use 1600x900 to display on host 2. Mount ISO through 'Virtual media' on OpenBMC's web 3. Run script as below on host to do sha continuously   #!/bin/bash   while [ [1] ];   do \tfind /media -type f -printf '\"%h/%f\"\\n' | xargs sha256sum   done 4. Open KVM on OpenBMC's web  The size of macro block captured is 8x8. Therefore, we should make sure the height of src-buf is 8 aligned to fix this issue.",
