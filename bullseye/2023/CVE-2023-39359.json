	"description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability was discovered which allows authenticated users to perform privilege escalation and remote code execution. The vulnerability resides in the `graphs.php` file. When dealing with the cases of ajax_hosts and ajax_hosts_noany, if the `site_id` parameter is greater than 0, it is directly reflected in the WHERE clause of the SQL statement. This creates an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
