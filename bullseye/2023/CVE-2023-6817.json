	"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.  The function nft_pipapo_walk did not skip inactive elements during set walk which could lead double deactivations of PIPAPO (Pile Packet Policies) elements, leading to use-after-free.  We recommend upgrading past commit 317eb9685095678f2c9f5a8189de698c5354316a.",
