	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length  If the host sends an H2CData command with an invalid DATAL, the kernel may crash in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec().  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 lr : nvmet_tcp_io_work+0x6ac/0x718 [nvmet_tcp] Call trace:   process_one_work+0x174/0x3c8   worker_thread+0x2d0/0x3e8   kthread+0x104/0x110  Fix the bug by raising a fatal error if DATAL isn't coherent with the packet size. Also, the PDU length should never exceed the MAXH2CDATA parameter which has been communicated to the host in nvmet_tcp_handle_icreq().",
