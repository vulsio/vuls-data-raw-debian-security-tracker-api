	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Fix potential memory leak in intel_setup_irq_remapping()  After commit e3beca48a45b (\"irqdomain/treewide: Keep firmware node unconditionally allocated\"). For tear down scenario, fn is only freed after fail to allocate ir_domain, though it also should be freed in case dmar_enable_qi returns error.  Besides free fn, irq_domain and ir_msi_domain need to be removed as well if intel_setup_irq_remapping fails to enable queued invalidation.  Improve the rewinding path by add out_free_ir_domain and out_free_fwnode lables per Baolu's suggestion.",
