	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: bridge: vlan: fix memory leak in __allowed_ingress  When using per-vlan state, if vlan snooping and stats are disabled, untagged or priority-tagged ingress frame will go to check pvid state. If the port state is forwarding and the pvid state is not learning/forwarding, untagged or priority-tagged frame will be dropped but skb memory is not freed. Should free skb when __allowed_ingress returns false.",
