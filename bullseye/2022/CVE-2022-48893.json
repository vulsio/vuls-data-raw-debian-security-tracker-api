	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/gt: Cleanup partial engine discovery failures  If we abort driver initialisation in the middle of gt/engine discovery, some engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely setup engines only have 'engine->release == NULL' and so will leak any of the common objects allocated.  v2:  - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now.  It's not really    worth it with just a single callsite at the moment.  (Janusz)",
