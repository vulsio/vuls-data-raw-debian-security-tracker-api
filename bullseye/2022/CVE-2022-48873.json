	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: Don't remove map on creater_process and device_release  Do not remove the map from the list on error path in fastrpc_init_create_process, instead call fastrpc_map_put, to avoid use-after-free. Do not remove it on fastrpc_device_release either, call fastrpc_map_put instead.  The fastrpc_free_map is the only proper place to remove the map. This is called only after the reference count is 0.",
