	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mscc: ocelot: fix use-after-free in ocelot_vlan_del()  ocelot_vlan_member_del() will free the struct ocelot_bridge_vlan, so if this is the same as the port's pvid_vlan which we access afterwards, what we're accessing is freed memory.  Fix the bug by determining whether to clear ocelot_port->pvid_vlan prior to calling ocelot_vlan_member_del().",
