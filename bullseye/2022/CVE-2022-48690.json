	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix DMA mappings leak  Fix leak, when user changes ring parameters. During reallocation of RX buffers, new DMA mappings are created for those buffers. New buffers with different RX ring count should substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in ice_vsi_cfg_rxq and reallocated again with ice_alloc_rx_buf. kfree on rx_buf caused leak of already mapped DMA. Reallocate ZC with xdp_buf struct, when BPF program loads. Reallocate back to rx_buf, when BPF program unloads. If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate RX queues accordingly in XDP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.  Steps for reproduction: while : do \tfor ((i=0; i<=8160; i=i+32)) \tdo \t\tethtool -G enp130s0f0 rx $i tx $i \t\tsleep 0.5 \t\tethtool -g enp130s0f0 \tdone done",
