	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode  Add a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a place where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.  Fixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed (\"perf/x86/intel/pt: Opportunistically use single range output mode\"), which added a support for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PT stop filter range is hit while tracing, the kernel will crash because of a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to calling pt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.  The commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of the ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable, but missed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware, which happens when execution hits a configured stop filter.  Tested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfully records a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch.",
