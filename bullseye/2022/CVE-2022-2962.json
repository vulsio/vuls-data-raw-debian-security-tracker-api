	"id": "CVE-2022-2962",
	"description": "A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU. When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.",
