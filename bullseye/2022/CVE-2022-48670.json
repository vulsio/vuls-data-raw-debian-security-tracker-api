	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in adev_release()  When auxiliary_device_add() returns an error, auxiliary_device_uninit() is called, which causes refcount for device to be decremented and .release callback will be triggered.  Because adev_release() re-calls auxiliary_device_uninit(), it will cause use-after-free: [ 1269.455172] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 14267 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x110/0x15 [ 1269.464007] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.",
