	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: af_can: fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rcv_filter  Analogue to commit 8aa59e355949 (\"can: af_can: fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rx_register()\") we need to check for a missing initialization of ml_priv in the receive path of CAN frames.  Since commit 4e096a18867a (\"net: introduce CAN specific pointer in the struct net_device\") the check for dev->type to be ARPHRD_CAN is not sufficient anymore since bonding or tun netdevices claim to be CAN devices but do not initialize ml_priv accordingly.",
