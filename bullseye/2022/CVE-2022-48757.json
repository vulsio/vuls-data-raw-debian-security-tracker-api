	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: fix information leakage in /proc/net/ptype  In one net namespace, after creating a packet socket without binding it to a device, users in other net namespaces can observe the new `packet_type` added by this packet socket by reading `/proc/net/ptype` file. This is minor information leakage as packet socket is namespace aware.  Add a net pointer in `packet_type` to keep the net namespace of of corresponding packet socket. In `ptype_seq_show`, this net pointer must be checked when it is not NULL.",
