	"description": "jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.",
