	"id": "CVE-2020-25827",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the OATHAuth extension in MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x through 1.34.x before 1.34.4. For Wikis using OATHAuth on a farm/cluster (such as via CentralAuth), rate limiting of OATH tokens is only done on a single site level. Thus, multiple requests can be made across many wikis/sites concurrently.",
