	"description": "The t2p_read_tiff_init function in tiff2pdf (tools/tiff2pdf.c) in LibTIFF 4.0.2 and earlier does not properly initialize the T2P context struct pointer in certain error conditions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
