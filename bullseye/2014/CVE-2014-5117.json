  "id": "CVE-2014-5117",
  "description": "Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit after an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct traffic-confirmation attacks by using the pattern of RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means of communicating information about hidden service names.",
