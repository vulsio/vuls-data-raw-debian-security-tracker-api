	"id": "CVE-2018-5736",
	"description": "An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion failure if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts several transfers of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be deliberately exercised by an attacker who is permitted to cause a vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers (for example: by sending valid NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit after failing the assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.",
