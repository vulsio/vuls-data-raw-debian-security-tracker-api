	"id": "CVE-2018-7162",
	"description": "All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash. This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS implementation.",
