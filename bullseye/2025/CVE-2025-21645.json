	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enabled it  Wakeup for IRQ1 should be disabled only in cases where i8042 had actually enabled it, otherwise \"wake_depth\" for this IRQ will try to drop below zero and there will be an unpleasant WARN() logged:  kernel: atkbd serio0: Disabling IRQ1 wakeup source to avoid platform firmware bug kernel: ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel: Unbalanced IRQ 1 wake disable kernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920 irq_set_irq_wake+0x147/0x1a0  The PMC driver uses DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() to define its dev_pm_ops which sets amd_pmc_suspend_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and .poweroff handlers. i8042_pm_suspend(), however, is only set as the .suspend handler.  Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set of dev_pm_ops handlers as i8042_pm_suspend(), which currently means just the .suspend handler.  To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh boot without putting it into s2idle first.  [ij: edited the commit message.]",
