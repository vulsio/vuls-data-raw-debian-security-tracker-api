	"description": "The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.",
