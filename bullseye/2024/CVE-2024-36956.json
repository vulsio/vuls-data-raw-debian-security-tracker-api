	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  thermal/debugfs: Free all thermal zone debug memory on zone removal  Because thermal_debug_tz_remove() does not free all memory allocated for thermal zone diagnostics, some of that memory becomes unreachable after freeing the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Address this by making thermal_debug_tz_remove() free all of the memory in question.  Cc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+",
