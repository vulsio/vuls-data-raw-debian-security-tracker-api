	"description": "Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27, some of the data stored in `automation_tree_rules_form_save()` function in `automation_tree_rules.php` is not thoroughly checked and is used to concatenate the HTML statement in `form_confirm()` function from `lib/html.php` , finally resulting in cross-site scripting. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.",
