	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211: check/clear fast rx for non-4addr sta VLAN changes  When moving a station out of a VLAN and deleting the VLAN afterwards, the fast_rx entry still holds a pointer to the VLAN's netdev, which can cause use-after-free bugs. Fix this by immediately calling ieee80211_check_fast_rx after the VLAN change.",
