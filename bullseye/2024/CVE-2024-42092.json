	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpio: davinci: Validate the obtained number of IRQs  Value of pdata->gpio_unbanked is taken from Device Tree. In case of broken DT due to any error this value can be any. Without this value validation there can be out of chips->irqs array boundaries access in davinci_gpio_probe().  Validate the obtained nirq value so that it won't exceed the maximum number of IRQs per bank.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
