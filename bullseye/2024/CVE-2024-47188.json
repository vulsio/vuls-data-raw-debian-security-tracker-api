	"id": "CVE-2024-47188",
	"description": "Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed for \"thash\" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.",
