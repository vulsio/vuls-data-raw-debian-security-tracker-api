	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: vhci-hcd: Do not drop references before new references are gained  At a few places the driver carries stale pointers to references that can still be used. Make sure that does not happen. This strictly speaking closes ZDI-CAN-22273, though there may be similar races in the driver.",
