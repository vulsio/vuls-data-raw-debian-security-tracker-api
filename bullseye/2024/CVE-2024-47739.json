	"id": "CVE-2024-47739",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow  When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected next.  To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.",
