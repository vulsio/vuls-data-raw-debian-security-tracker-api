	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs  The commit b8c43360f6e4 (\"net: stmmac: No need to calculate speed divider when offload is disabled\") allows the \"port_transmit_rate_kbps\" to be set to a value of 0, which is then passed to the \"div_s64\" function when tc-cbs is disabled. This leads to a zero-division error.  When tc-cbs is disabled, the idleslope, sendslope, and credit values the credit values are not required to be configured. Therefore, adding a return statement after setting the txQ mode to DCB when tc-cbs is disabled would prevent a zero-division error.",
