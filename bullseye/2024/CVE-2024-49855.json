	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nbd: fix race between timeout and normal completion  If request timetout is handled by nbd_requeue_cmd(), normal completion has to be stopped for avoiding to complete this requeued request, other use-after-free can be triggered.  Fix the race by clearing NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT in nbd_requeue_cmd(), meantime make sure that cmd->lock is grabbed for clearing the flag and the requeue.",
