	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: force a dst refcount before doing decryption  As it says in commit 3bc07321ccc2 (\"xfrm: Force a dst refcount before entering the xfrm type handlers\"):  \"Crypto requests might return asynchronous. In this case we leave the  rcu protected region, so force a refcount on the skb's destination  entry before we enter the xfrm type input/output handlers.\"  On TIPC decryption path it has the same problem, and skb_dst_force() should be called before doing decryption to avoid a possible crash.
