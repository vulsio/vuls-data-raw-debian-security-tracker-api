	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gve: Clear napi->skb before dev_kfree_skb_any()  gve_rx_free_skb incorrectly leaves napi->skb referencing an skb after it is freed with dev_kfree_skb_any(). This can result in a subsequent call to napi_get_frags returning a dangling pointer.  Fix this by clearing napi->skb before the skb is freed.",
