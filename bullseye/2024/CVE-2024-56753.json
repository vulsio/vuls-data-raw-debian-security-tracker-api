	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module  This commit addresses an omission in the previous patch related to the cleaner shader support for GFX9 hardware. Specifically, it adds the necessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in the gfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.  The added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that any allocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoiding potential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for the next initialization sequence.",
