	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/panthor: Fix access to uninitialized variable in tick_ctx_cleanup()  The group variable can't be used to retrieve ptdev in our second loop, because it points to the previously iterated list_head, not a valid group. Get the ptdev object from the scheduler instead.",
