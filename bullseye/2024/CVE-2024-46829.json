	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtmutex: Drop rt_mutex::wait_lock before scheduling  rt_mutex_handle_deadlock() is called with rt_mutex::wait_lock held.  In the good case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits a warning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which triggers the 'scheduling in atomic' warning.  Unlock rt_mutex::wait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning and dropping into the schedule for ever loop.  [ tglx: Moved unlock before the WARN(), removed the pointless comment,   \tmassaged changelog, added Fixes tag ]",
