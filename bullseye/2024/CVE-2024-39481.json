	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mc: Fix graph walk in media_pipeline_start  The graph walk tries to follow all links, even if they are not between pads. This causes a crash with, e.g. a MEDIA_LNK_FL_ANCILLARY_LINK link.  Fix this by allowing the walk to proceed only for MEDIA_LNK_FL_DATA_LINK links.",
