	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: huge_memory: use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines  Yves-Alexis Perez reported commit 4ef9ad19e176 (\"mm: huge_memory: don't force huge page alignment on 32 bit\") didn't work for x86_32 [1].  It is because x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT.  !CONFIG_64BIT should cover all 32 bit machines.
