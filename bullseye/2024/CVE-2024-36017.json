	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation  Each attribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be a struct ifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at least of sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes. The current size validation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes) which is less than sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validation is not enough and a too small attribute might be cast to a struct ifla_vf_vlan_info, this might result in an out of bands read access when accessing the saved (casted) entry in ivvl.",
