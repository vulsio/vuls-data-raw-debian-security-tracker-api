	"id": "CVE-2024-39491",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance  The cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe() so it should be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing call to cs_dsp_remove() in the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().  The call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done in the component unbind callback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver was unbound and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dsp instance.  It is best to initialize the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that it can return an error if it fails. The component binding API doesn't have any error handling so there's no way to handle a failure if cs_dsp was initialized in the bind.",
