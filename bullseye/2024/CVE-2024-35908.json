	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tls: get psock ref after taking rxlock to avoid leak  At the start of tls_sw_recvmsg, we take a reference on the psock, and then call tls_rx_reader_lock. If that fails, we return directly without releasing the reference.  Instead of adding a new label, just take the reference after locking has succeeded, since we don't need it before.",
