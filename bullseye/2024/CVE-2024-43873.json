	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vhost/vsock: always initialize seqpacket_allow  There are two issues around seqpacket_allow: 1. seqpacket_allow is not initialized when socket is    created. Thus if features are never set, it will be    read uninitialized. 2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared,    then seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately    (existing apps I know about don't usually do this but     it's legal and there's no way to be sure no one relies     on this).  To fix: \t- initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation \t- set it unconditionally in set_features",
