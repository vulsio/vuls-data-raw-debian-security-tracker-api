	"id": "CVE-2024-46901",
	"description": "Insufficient validation of filenames against control characters in Apache Subversion repositories served via mod_dav_svn allows authenticated users with commit access to commit a corrupted revision, leading to disruption for users of the repository.  All versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.4 are affected if serving repositories via mod_dav_svn. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.14.5, which fixes this issue.  Repositories served via other access methods are not affected.",
