	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: ensure snd_una is properly initialized on connect  This is strictly related to commit fb7a0d334894 (\"mptcp: ensure snd_nxt is properly initialized on connect\"). It turns out that syzkaller can trigger the retransmit after fallback and before processing any other incoming packet - so that snd_una is still left uninitialized.  Address the issue explicitly initializing snd_una together with snd_nxt and write_seq.",
