	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: dev: can_set_termination(): allow sleeping GPIOs  In commit 6e86a1543c37 (\"can: dev: provide optional GPIO based termination support\") GPIO based termination support was added.  For no particular reason that patch uses gpiod_set_value() to set the GPIO. This leads to the following warning, if the systems uses a sleeping GPIO, i.e. behind an I2C port expander:  | WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 379 at /drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:3496 gpiod_set_value+0x50/0x6c | CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 379 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.11.0-20241016-1 #1 823affae360cc91126e4d316d7a614a8bf86236c  Replace gpiod_set_value() by gpiod_set_value_cansleep() to allow the use of sleeping GPIOs.",
