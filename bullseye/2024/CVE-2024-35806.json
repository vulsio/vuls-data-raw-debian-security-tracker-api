	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: fsl: qbman: Always disable interrupts when taking cgr_lock  smp_call_function_single disables IRQs when executing the callback. To prevent deadlocks, we must disable IRQs when taking cgr_lock elsewhere. This is already done by qman_update_cgr and qman_delete_cgr; fix the other lockers.",
