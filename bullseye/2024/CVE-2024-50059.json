	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix use after free vulnerability in switchtec_ntb_remove due to race condition  In the switchtec_ntb_add function, it can call switchtec_ntb_init_sndev function, then &sndev->check_link_status_work is bound with check_link_status_work. switchtec_ntb_link_notification may be called to start the work.  If we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to make cleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                 CPU1                          | check_link_status_work switchtec_ntb_remove    | kfree(sndev);           |                         | if (sndev->link_force_down)                         | // use sndev  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.",
