	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: Fix the memory allocation issue in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info()  Fix two issues with memory allocation in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info() for mem_ranges:   - Add a check for allocation failure to avoid dereferencing a null    pointer.   - As suggested by Christophe, use kvcalloc() for memory allocation,    which checks for multiplication overflow.  Additionally, assign the output parameters nps_type and range_cnt after the kvcalloc() call to prevent modifying the output parameters in case of an error return.",
