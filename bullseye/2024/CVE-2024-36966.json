	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: reliably distinguish block based and fscache mode  When erofs_kill_sb() is called in block dev based mode, s_bdev may not have been initialised yet, and if CONFIG_EROFS_FS_ONDEMAND is enabled, it will be mistaken for fscache mode, and then attempt to free an anon_dev that has never been allocated, triggering the following warning:  ============================================ ida_free called for id=0 which is not allocated.
