	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: release elements in clone only from destroy path  Clone already always provides a current view of the lookup table, use it to destroy the set, otherwise it is possible to destroy elements twice.  This fix requires:   212ed75dc5fb (\"netfilter: nf_tables: integrate pipapo into commit protocol\")  which came after:   9827a0e6e23b (\"netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: release elements in clone from abort path\").",
