	"id": "CVE-2024-32039",
	"description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. FreeRDP based clients using a version of FreeRDP prior to 3.5.0 or 2.11.6 are vulnerable to integer overflow and out-of-bounds write. Versions 3.5.0 and 2.11.6 patch the issue. As a workaround, do not use `/gfx` options (e.g. deactivate with `/bpp:32` or `/rfx` as it is on by default).",
