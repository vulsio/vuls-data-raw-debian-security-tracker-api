	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: venus: fix use after free bug in venus_remove due to race condition  in venus_probe, core->work is bound with venus_sys_error_handler, which is used to handle error. The code use core->sys_err_done to make sync work. The core->work is started in venus_event_notify.  If we call venus_remove, there might be an unfished work. The possible sequence is as follows:  CPU0                  CPU1                       |venus_sys_error_handler venus_remove         | hfi_destroy\t \t\t | venus_hfi_destroy\t | kfree(hdev);\t     |                      |hfi_reinit \t\t\t\t\t |venus_hfi_queues_reinit                      |//use hdev  Fix it by canceling the work in venus_remove.",
