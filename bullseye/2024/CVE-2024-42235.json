	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/mm: Add NULL pointer check to crst_table_free() base_crst_free()  crst_table_free() used to work with NULL pointers before the conversion to ptdescs.  Since crst_table_free() can be called with a NULL pointer (error handling in crst_table_upgrade() add an explicit check.  Also add the same check to base_crst_free() for consistency reasons.  In real life this should not happen, since order two GFP_KERNEL allocations will not fail, unless FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC is enabled and used.",
