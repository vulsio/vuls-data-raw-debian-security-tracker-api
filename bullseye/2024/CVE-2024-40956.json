	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: idxd: Fix possible Use-After-Free in irq_process_work_list  Use list_for_each_entry_safe() to allow iterating through the list and deleting the entry in the iteration process. The descriptor is freed via idxd_desc_complete() and there's a slight chance may cause issue for the list iterator when the descriptor is reused by another thread without it being deleted from the list.",
