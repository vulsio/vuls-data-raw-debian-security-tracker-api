	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error  The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed successfully.  In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the `migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.  This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.  To prevent this vulnerability, we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of an error, a non-dirty (zero) page will be returned to the user.",
