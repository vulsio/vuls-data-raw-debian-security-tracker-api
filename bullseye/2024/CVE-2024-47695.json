	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rtrs-clt: Reset cid to con_num - 1 to stay in bounds  In the function init_conns(), after the create_con() and create_cm() for loop if something fails. In the cleanup for loop after the destroy tag, we access out of bound memory because cid is set to clt_path->s.con_num.  This commits resets the cid to clt_path->s.con_num - 1, to stay in bounds in the cleanup loop later.",
