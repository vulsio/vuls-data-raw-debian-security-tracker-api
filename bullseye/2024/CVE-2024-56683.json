	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vc4: hdmi: Avoid hang with debug registers when suspended  Trying to read /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/hdmi1_regs when the hdmi is disconnected results in a fatal system hang.  This is due to the pm suspend code disabling the dvp clock. That is just a gate of the 108MHz clock in DVP_HT_RPI_MISC_CONFIG, which results in accesses hanging AXI bus.  Protect against this.",
