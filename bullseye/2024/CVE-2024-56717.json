	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: mscc: ocelot: fix incorrect IFH SRC_PORT field in ocelot_ifh_set_basic()  Packets injected by the CPU should have a SRC_PORT field equal to the CPU port module index in the Analyzer block (ocelot->num_phys_ports).  The blamed commit copied the ocelot_ifh_set_basic() call incorrectly from ocelot_xmit_common() in net/dsa/tag_ocelot.c. Instead of calling with \"x\", it calls with BIT_ULL(x), but the field is not a port mask, but rather a single port index.  [ side note: this is the technical debt of code duplication :( ]  The error used to be silent and doesn't appear to have other user-visible manifestations, but with new changes in the packing library, it now fails loudly as follows:  ------------[ cut here ]------------ Cannot store 0x40 inside bits 46-43 - will truncate sja1105 spi2.0: xmit timed out WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 102 at lib/packing.c:98 __pack+0x90/0x198 sja1105 spi2.0: timed out polling for tstamp CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 102 Comm: felix_xmit Tainted: G        W        N 6.13.0-rc1-00372-gf706b85d972d-dirty #2605 Call trace:  __pack+0x90/0x198 (P)  __pack+0x90/0x198 (L)  packing+0x78/0x98  ocelot_ifh_set_basic+0x260/0x368  ocelot_port_inject_frame+0xa8/0x250  felix_port_deferred_xmit+0x14c/0x258  kthread_worker_fn+0x134/0x350  kthread+0x114/0x138  The code path pertains to the ocelot switchdev driver and to the felix secondary DSA tag protocol, ocelot-8021q. Here seen with ocelot-8021q.  The messenger (packing) is not really to blame, so fix the original commit instead.",
