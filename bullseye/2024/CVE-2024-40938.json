	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  landlock: Fix d_parent walk  The WARN_ON_ONCE() in collect_domain_accesses() can be triggered when trying to link a root mount point.  This cannot work in practice because this directory is mounted, but the VFS check is done after the call to security_path_link().  Do not use source directory's d_parent when the source directory is the mount point.  [mic: Fix commit message]",
