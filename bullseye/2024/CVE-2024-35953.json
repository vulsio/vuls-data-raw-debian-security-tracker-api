	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  accel/ivpu: Fix deadlock in context_xa  ivpu_device->context_xa is locked both in kernel thread and IRQ context. It requires XA_FLAGS_LOCK_IRQ flag to be passed during initialization otherwise the lock could be acquired from a thread and interrupted by an IRQ that locks it for the second time causing the deadlock.  This deadlock was reported by lockdep and observed in internal tests.",
