	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: tcpm: fix use-after-free case in tcpm_register_source_caps  There could be a potential use-after-free case in tcpm_register_source_caps(). This could happen when:  * new (say invalid) source caps are advertised  * the existing source caps are unregistered  * tcpm_register_source_caps() returns with an error as    usb_power_delivery_register_capabilities() fails  This causes port->partner_source_caps to hold on to the now freed source caps.  Reset port->partner_source_caps value to NULL after unregistering existing source caps.",
