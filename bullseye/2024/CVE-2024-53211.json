	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/l2tp: fix warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot  In l2tp's net exit handler, we check that an IDR is empty before destroying it:  \tWARN_ON_ONCE(!idr_is_empty(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr)); \tidr_destroy(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr);  By forcing memory allocation failures in idr_alloc_32, syzbot is able to provoke a condition where idr_is_empty returns false despite there being no items in the IDR. This turns out to be because the radix tree of the IDR contains only internal radix-tree nodes and it is this that causes idr_is_empty to return false. The internal nodes are cleaned by idr_destroy.  Use idr_for_each to check that the IDR is empty instead of idr_is_empty to avoid the problem.",
