	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix verifier assumptions about socket->sk  The verifier assumes that 'sk' field in 'struct socket' is valid and non-NULL when 'socket' pointer itself is trusted and non-NULL. That may not be the case when socket was just created and passed to LSM socket_accept hook. Fix this verifier assumption and adjust tests.",
