	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  af_packet: avoid erroring out after sock_init_data() in packet_create()  After sock_init_data() the allocated sk object is attached to the provided sock object. On error, packet_create() frees the sk object leaving the dangling pointer in the sock object on return. Some other code may try to use this pointer and cause use-after-free.",
