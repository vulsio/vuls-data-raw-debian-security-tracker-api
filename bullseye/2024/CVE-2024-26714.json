	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  interconnect: qcom: sc8180x: Mark CO0 BCM keepalive  The CO0 BCM needs to be up at all times, otherwise some hardware (like the UFS controller) loses its connection to the rest of the SoC, resulting in a hang of the platform, accompanied by a spectacular logspam.  Mark it as keepalive to prevent such cases.",
