	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: u_serial: Disable ep before setting port to null to fix the crash caused by port being null  Considering that in some extreme cases, when performing the unbinding operation, gserial_disconnect has cleared gser->ioport, which triggers gadget reconfiguration, and then calls gs_read_complete, resulting in access to a null pointer. Therefore, ep is disabled before gserial_disconnect sets port to null to prevent this from happening.
