	"id": "CVE-2024-6874",
	"description": "libcurl's URL API function [curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycode conversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256 bytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to use the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the provided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.  This flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of the converted string.",
