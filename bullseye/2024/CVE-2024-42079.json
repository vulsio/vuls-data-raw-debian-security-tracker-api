	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gfs2: Fix NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_log_flush  In gfs2_jindex_free(), set sdp->sd_jdesc to NULL under the log flush lock to provide exclusion against gfs2_log_flush().  In gfs2_log_flush(), check if sdp->sd_jdesc is non-NULL before dereferencing it.  Otherwise, we could run into a NULL pointer dereference when outstanding glock work races with an unmount (glock_work_func -> run_queue -> do_xmote -> inode_go_sync -> gfs2_log_flush).",
