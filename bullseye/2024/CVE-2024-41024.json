	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: Restrict untrusted app to attach to privileged PD  Untrusted application with access to only non-secure fastrpc device node can attach to root_pd or static PDs if it can make the respective init request. This can cause problems as the untrusted application can send bad requests to root_pd or static PDs. Add changes to reject attach to privileged PDs if the request is being made using non-secure fastrpc device node.",
