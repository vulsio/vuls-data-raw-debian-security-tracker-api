	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  erofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format  EROFS can select compression algorithms on a per-file basis, and each per-file compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk superblock for initialization.  However, syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use an unsupported algorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA algorithmtype even it's not set in `sbi->available_compr_algs`.  This can lead to an unexpected \"BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference\" if the corresponding decompressor isn't built-in.  Fix this by checking against `sbi->available_compr_algs` for each m_algorithmformat request.  Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset bitmap is now fixed together since it was harmless previously.",
