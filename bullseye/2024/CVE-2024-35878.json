	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  of: module: prevent NULL pointer dereference in vsnprintf()  In of_modalias(), we can get passed the str and len parameters which would cause a kernel oops in vsnprintf() since it only allows passing a NULL ptr when the length is also 0. Also, we need to filter out the negative values of the len parameter as these will result in a really huge buffer since snprintf() takes size_t parameter while ours is ssize_t...  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace static analysis tool.",
