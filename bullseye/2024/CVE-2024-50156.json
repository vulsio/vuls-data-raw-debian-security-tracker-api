	"id": "CVE-2024-50156",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()  If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then `block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function _does_ have code to try to handle it with:    if (*reg)     dump_addr = *reg;  ...but since \"dump_addr\" is initialized to NULL the above is actually a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.  Make the function print \"Registers not stored\" when it sees a NULL to solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer and properly mark the pointer as `const`.
