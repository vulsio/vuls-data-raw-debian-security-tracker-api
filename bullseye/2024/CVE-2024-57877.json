	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE  Currently poe_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl' variable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this uninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to target->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.  Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG, NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing contents of POR_EL1 will be retained.
