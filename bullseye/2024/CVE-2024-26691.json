	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: arm64: Fix circular locking dependency  The rule inside kvm enforces that the vcpu->mutex is taken *inside* kvm->lock. The rule is violated by the pkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires the kvm->lock while already holding the vcpu->mutex lock from kvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular locking dependency altogether by protecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock, much like we already do for other forms of VM-scoped data.",
