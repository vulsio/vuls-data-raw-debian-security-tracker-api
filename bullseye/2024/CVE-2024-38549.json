	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek: Add 0 size check to mtk_drm_gem_obj  Add a check to mtk_drm_gem_init if we attempt to allocate a GEM object of 0 bytes. Currently, no such check exists and the kernel will panic if a userspace application attempts to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer.  Tested by attempting to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer on an MT8188 and verifying that we now return EINVAL.",
