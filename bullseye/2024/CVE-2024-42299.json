	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: Update log->page_{mask,bits} if log->page_size changed  If an NTFS file system is mounted to another system with different PAGE_SIZE from the original system, log->page_size will change in log_replay(), but log->page_{mask,bits} don't change correspondingly. This will cause a panic because \"u32 bytes = log->page_size - page_off\" will get a negative value in the later read_log_page().",
