	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  uprobes: fix kernel info leak via \"[uprobes]\" vma  xol_add_vma() maps the uninitialized page allocated by __create_xol_area() into userspace. On some architectures (x86) this memory is readable even without VM_READ, VM_EXEC results in the same pgprot_t as VM_EXEC|VM_READ, although this doesn't really matter, debugger can read this memory anyway.",
