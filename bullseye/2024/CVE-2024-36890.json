	"id": "CVE-2024-36890",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers  Currently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer that will lead to a crash.  An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show().     171\tchar *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i);    172\tif (IS_ERR(label)) {    173\t\tdev_err(wm831x->dev, \"Failed to duplicate label\\n\");    174\t\tcontinue;    175  }  The auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well, otherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.",
