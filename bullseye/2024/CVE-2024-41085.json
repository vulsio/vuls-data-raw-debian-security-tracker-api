	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling  When CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxl endpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace.   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000078  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page  RIP: 0010:cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]  Call Trace:   <TASK>   ? __die+0x24/0x70   ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160   ? do_user_addr_fault+0x65/0x6b0   ? exc_page_fault+0x7d/0x170   ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30   ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]   ? cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x1ac/0x360 [cxl_pmem]   cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]   really_probe+0x173/0x410   ? __pfx___device_attach_driver+0x10/0x10   __driver_probe_device+0x80/0x170   driver_probe_device+0x1e/0x90   __device_attach_driver+0x90/0x120   bus_for_each_drv+0x84/0xe0   __device_attach+0xbc/0x1f0   bus_probe_device+0x90/0xa0   device_add+0x51c/0x710   devm_cxl_add_pmem_region+0x1b5/0x380 [cxl_core]   cxl_bus_probe+0x1b/0x60 [cxl_core]  The cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem region probe. Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe. The endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause a pmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust the sequence so this dependency is met.  This requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that can be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not yet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so start the query from there instead.",
