	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ep93xx: clock: Fix off by one in ep93xx_div_recalc_rate()  The psc->div[] array has psc->num_div elements.  These values come from when we call clk_hw_register_div().  It's adc_divisors and ARRAY_SIZE(adc_divisors)) and so on.  So this condition needs to be >= instead of > to prevent an out of bounds read.",
