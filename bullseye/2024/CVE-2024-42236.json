	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: gadget: configfs: Prevent OOB read/write in usb_string_copy()  Userspace provided string 's' could trivially have the length zero. Left unchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in the form `if (str[0 - 1] == '\\n') followed closely by an OOB write in the form `str[0 - 1] = '\\0'`.  There is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long. Let's supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.",
