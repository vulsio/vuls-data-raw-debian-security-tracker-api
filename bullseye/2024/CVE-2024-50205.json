	"id": "CVE-2024-50205",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: firewire-lib: Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size()  The step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop, but if it's not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable check before the division.  The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b (\"ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size\"), and it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters will satisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from the amdtp_rate_table[] table.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
