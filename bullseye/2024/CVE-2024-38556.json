	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Add a timeout to acquire the command queue semaphore  Prevent forced completion handling on an entry that has not yet been assigned an index, causing an out of bounds access on idx = -22. Instead of waiting indefinitely for the sem, blocking flow now waits for index to be allocated or a sem acquisition timeout before beginning the timer for FW completion.  Kernel log example: mlx5_core 0000:06:00.0: wait_func_handle_exec_timeout:1128:(pid 185911): cmd[-22]: CREATE_UCTX(0xa04) No done completion",
