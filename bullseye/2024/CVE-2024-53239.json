	"id": "CVE-2024-53239",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: 6fire: Release resources at card release  The current 6fire code tries to release the resources right after the call of usb6fire_chip_abort().  But at this moment, the card object might be still in use (as we're calling snd_card_free_when_closed()).  For avoid potential UAFs, move the release of resources to the card's private_free instead of the manual call of usb6fire_chip_destroy() at the USB disconnect callback.",
