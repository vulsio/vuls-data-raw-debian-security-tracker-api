	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: use aligned address in copy_user_gigantic_page()  In current kernel, hugetlb_wp() calls copy_user_large_folio() with the fault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size.  Then, copy_user_large_folio() may call copy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, while copy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' for copy_user_gigantic_page().",
