	"id": "CVE-2024-43890",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()  \"tracing_map->next_elt\" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.  Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached. Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the tracing_map containing \"tracing_map->max_size\" elements, leaving no empty entries. If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using `__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.  Fix this by preventing any further increments to \"tracing_map->next_elt\" once it reaches \"tracing_map->max_elt\".",
