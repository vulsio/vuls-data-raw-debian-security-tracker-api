	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: check dot and dotdot of dx_root before making dir indexed  Syzbot reports a issue as follows: ============================================ BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffed11022e24fe PGD 23ffee067 P4D 23ffee067 PUD 0 Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI CPU: 0 PID: 5079 Comm: syz-executor306 Not tainted 6.10.0-rc5-g55027e689933 #0 Call Trace:  <TASK>  make_indexed_dir+0xdaf/0x13c0 fs/ext4/namei.c:2341  ext4_add_entry+0x222a/0x25d0 fs/ext4/namei.c:2451  ext4_rename fs/ext4/namei.c:3936 [inline]  ext4_rename2+0x26e5/0x4370 fs/ext4/namei.c:4214 [...] ============================================  The immediate cause of this problem is that there is only one valid dentry for the block to be split during do_split, so split==0 results in out of bounds accesses to the map triggering the issue.      do_split       unsigned split       dx_make_map        count = 1       split = count/2 = 0;       continued = hash2 == map[split - 1].hash;        ---> map[4294967295]  The maximum length of a filename is 255 and the minimum block size is 1024, so it is always guaranteed that the number of entries is greater than or equal to 2 when do_split() is called.  But syzbot's crafted image has no dot and dotdot in dir, and the dentry distribution in dirblock is as follows:    bus     dentry1          hole           dentry2           free |xx--|xx-------------|...............|xx-------------|...............| 0   12 (8+248)=256  268     256     524 (8+256)=264 788     236     1024  So when renaming dentry1 increases its name_len length by 1, neither hole nor free is sufficient to hold the new dentry, and make_indexed_dir() is called.  In make_indexed_dir() it is assumed that the first two entries of the dirblock must be dot and dotdot, so bus and dentry1 are left in dx_root because they are treated as dot and dotdot, and only dentry2 is moved to the new leaf block. That's why count is equal to 1.  Therefore add the ext4_check_dx_root() helper function to add more sanity checks to dot and dotdot before starting the conversion to avoid the above issue.",
