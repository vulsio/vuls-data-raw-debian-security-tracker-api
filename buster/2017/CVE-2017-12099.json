	"description": "An exploitable integer overflow exists in the upgrade of the legacy Mesh attribute 'tface' of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c. A specially crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to open the file or use it as a library in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
