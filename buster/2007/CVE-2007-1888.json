  "id": "CVE-2007-1888",
  "description": "Buffer overflow in the sqlite_decode_binary function in src/encode.c in SQLite 2, as used by PHP 4.x through 5.x and other applications, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via an empty value of the in parameter.  NOTE: some PHP installations use a bundled version of sqlite without this vulnerability.  The SQLite developer has argued that this issue could be due to a misuse of the sqlite_decode_binary() API.",
