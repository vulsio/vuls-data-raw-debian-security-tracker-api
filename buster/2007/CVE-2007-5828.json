	"id": "CVE-2007-5828",
	"description": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the admin panel in Django 0.96 allows remote attackers to change passwords of arbitrary users via a request to admin/auth/user/1/password/.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by Debian, since product documentation includes a recommendation for a CSRF protection module that is included with the product.  However, CVE considers this an issue because the default configuration does not use this module",
