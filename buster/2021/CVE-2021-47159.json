	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: fix a crash if ->get_sset_count() fails  If ds->ops->get_sset_count() fails then it \"count\" is a negative error code such as -EOPNOTSUPP.  Because \"i\" is an unsigned int, the negative error code is type promoted to a very high value and the loop will corrupt memory until the system crashes.  Fix this by checking for error codes and changing the type of \"i\" to just int.",
