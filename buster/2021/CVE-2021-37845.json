	"id": "CVE-2021-37845",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Citadel through webcit-932. A meddler-in-the-middle attacker can fixate their own session during the cleartext phase before a STARTTLS command (a violation of \"The STARTTLS command is only valid in non-authenticated state.\" in RFC2595). This potentially allows an attacker to cause a victim's e-mail messages to be stored into an attacker's IMAP mailbox, but depends on details of the victim's client behavior.",
