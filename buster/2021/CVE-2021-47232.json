	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: j1939: fix Use-after-Free, hold skb ref while in use  This patch fixes a Use-after-Free found by the syzbot.  The problem is that a skb is taken from the per-session skb queue, without incrementing the ref count.
