	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: remove device from smcd_dev_list after failed device_add()  If the device_add() for a smcd_dev fails, there's no cleanup step that rolls back the earlier list_add(). The device subsequently gets freed, and we end up with a corrupted list.  Add some error handling that removes the device from the list.",
