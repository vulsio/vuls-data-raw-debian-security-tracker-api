	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix potential VPE leak on error  In its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc, when its_vpe_init() returns an error, there is an off-by-one in the number of VPEs to be freed.  Fix it by simply passing the number of VPEs allocated, which is the index of the loop iterating over the VPEs.  [maz: fixed commit message]",
