	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ARM: footbridge: fix PCI interrupt mapping  Since commit 30fdfb929e82 (\"PCI: Add a call to pci_assign_irq() in pci_device_probe()\"), the PCI code will call the IRQ mapping function whenever a PCI driver is probed. If these are marked as __init, this causes an oops if a PCI driver is loaded or bound after the kernel has initialised.",
