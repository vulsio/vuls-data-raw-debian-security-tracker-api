	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers  Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing useful, see d81269fecb8ce (\"io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension\").  Do that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep it signed.",
