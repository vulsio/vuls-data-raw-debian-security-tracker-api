	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  m68k: mvme147,mvme16x: Don't wipe PCC timer config bits  Don't clear the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing the interrupt flag and counter overflow. As Michael reported, \"This results in no timer interrupts being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs in calibrate_delay as the jiffies counter is not updated.\"  On mvme16x, enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent with mvme147.",
