	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration  Syzbot has reported warning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by work->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization.  This may happen, since input_dev->close() calls cancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization happens _after_ input_register_device() call.  So this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering input device",
