	"id": "CVE-2021-47293",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: act_skbmod: Skip non-Ethernet packets  Currently tcf_skbmod_act() assumes that packets use Ethernet as their L2 protocol, which is not always the case.  As an example, for CAN devices:  \t$ ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan \t$ ip link set up vcan0 \t$ tc qdisc add dev vcan0 root handle 1: htb \t$ tc filter add dev vcan0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 10 \\ \t\tmatchall action skbmod swap mac  Doing the above silently corrupts all the packets.  Do not perform skbmod actions for non-Ethernet packets.",
