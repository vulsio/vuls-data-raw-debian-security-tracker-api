	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use after free in __vmbus_open()  The \"open_info\" variable is added to the &vmbus_connection.chn_msg_list, but the error handling frees \"open_info\" without removing it from the list.  This will result in a use after free.  First remove it from the list, and then free it.",
