	"description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.95 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single  request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request  smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11Â onwards, 10.1.16 onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.",
