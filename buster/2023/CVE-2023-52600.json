	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix uaf in jfs_evict_inode  When the execution of diMount(ipimap) fails, the object ipimap that has been released may be accessed in diFreeSpecial(). Asynchronous ipimap release occurs when rcu_core() calls jfs_free_node().  Therefore, when diMount(ipimap) fails, sbi->ipimap should not be initialized as ipimap.",
