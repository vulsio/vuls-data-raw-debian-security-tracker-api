	"id": "CVE-2023-5752",
	"description": "When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL  (ie \"pip install  hg+...\") with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could  be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the \"hg clone\"  call (ie \"--config\"). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can modify  how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not  affect users who aren't installing from Mercurial.",
