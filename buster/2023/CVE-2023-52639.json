	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation  Right now it is possible to see gmap->private being zero in kvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in a crash.  This is due to the fact that we add gmap->private == kvm after creation:  static int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,                                struct vsie_page *vsie_page) { [...]         gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce, edat);         if (IS_ERR(gmap))                 return PTR_ERR(gmap);         gmap->private = vcpu->kvm;  Let children inherit the private field of the parent.",
