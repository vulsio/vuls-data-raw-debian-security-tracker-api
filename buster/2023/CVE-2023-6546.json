	"id": "CVE-2023-6546",
	"description": "A race condition was found in the GSM 0710 tty multiplexor in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when two threads execute the GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctl on the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled, and can lead to a use-after-free problem on a struct gsm_dlci while restarting the gsm mux. This could allow a local unprivileged user to escalate their privileges on the system.",
