	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ravb: Fix use-after-free issue in ravb_tx_timeout_work()  The ravb_stop() should call cancel_work_sync(). Otherwise, ravb_tx_timeout_work() is possible to use the freed priv after ravb_remove() was called like below:  CPU0\t\t\tCPU1 \t\t\travb_tx_timeout() ravb_remove() unregister_netdev() free_netdev(ndev) // free priv \t\t\travb_tx_timeout_work() \t\t\t// use priv  unregister_netdev() will call .ndo_stop() so that ravb_stop() is called. And, after phy_stop() is called, netif_carrier_off() is also called. So that .ndo_tx_timeout() will not be called after phy_stop().",
