	"id": "CVE-2023-52445",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnection  Upon module load, a kthread is created targeting the pvr2_context_thread_func function, which may call pvr2_context_destroy and thus call kfree() on the context object. However, that might happen before the usb hub_event handler is able to notify the driver. This patch adds a sanity check before the invalid read reported by syzbot, within the context disconnection call stack.",
