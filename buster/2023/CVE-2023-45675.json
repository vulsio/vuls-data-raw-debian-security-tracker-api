	"id": "CVE-2023-45675",
	"description": "stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in `f->vendor[len] = (char)'\\0';`. The root cause is that if the len read in `start_decoder` is `-1` and `len + 1` becomes 0 when passed to `setup_malloc`. The `setup_malloc` behaves differently when `f->alloc.alloc_buffer` is pre-allocated. Instead of returning `NULL` as in `malloc` case it shifts the pre-allocated buffer by zero and returns the currently available memory block. This issue may lead to code execution.",
