	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: topology: fix possible overflow in amu_fie_setup()  cpufreq_get_hw_max_freq() returns max frequency in kHz as *unsigned int*, while freq_inv_set_max_ratio() gets passed this frequency in Hz as 'u64'. Multiplying max frequency by 1000 can potentially result in overflow -- multiplying by 1000ULL instead should avoid that...  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static analysis tool.",
