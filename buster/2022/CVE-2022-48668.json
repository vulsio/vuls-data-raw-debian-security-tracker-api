	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb3: fix temporary data corruption in collapse range  collapse range doesn't discard the affected cached region so can risk temporarily corrupting the file data. This fixes xfstest generic/031  I also decided to merge a minor cleanup to this into the same patch (avoiding rereading inode size repeatedly unnecessarily) to make it clearer.",
