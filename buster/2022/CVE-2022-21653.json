  "id": "CVE-2022-21653",
  "description": "Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision attack which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection.",
