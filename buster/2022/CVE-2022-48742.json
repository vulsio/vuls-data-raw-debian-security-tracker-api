	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rtnetlink: make sure to refresh master_dev/m_ops in __rtnl_newlink()  While looking at one unrelated syzbot bug, I found the replay logic in __rtnl_newlink() to potentially trigger use-after-free.  It is better to clear master_dev and m_ops inside the loop, in case we have to replay it.",
