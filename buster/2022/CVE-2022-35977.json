	"id": "CVE-2022-35977",
	"description": "Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SETRANGE` and `SORT(_RO)` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an out-of-memory (OOM) panic. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.8, 6.2.9 and 6.0.17. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
