	"description": "libavcodec/pthread_frame.c in FFmpeg before 5.1.2, as used in VLC and other products, leaves stale hwaccel state in worker threads, which allows attackers to trigger a use-after-free and execute arbitrary code in some circumstances (e.g., hardware re-initialization upon a mid-video SPS change when Direct3D11 is used).",
