	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: arm_scmi: Harden accesses to the reset domains  Accessing reset domains descriptors by the index upon the SCMI drivers requests through the SCMI reset operations interface can potentially lead to out-of-bound violations if the SCMI driver misbehave.  Add an internal consistency check before any such domains descriptors accesses.",
