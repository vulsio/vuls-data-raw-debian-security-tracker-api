  "id": "CVE-2018-20752",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Recon-ng before 4.9.5. Lack of validation in the modules/reporting/csv.py file allows CSV injection. More specifically, when a Twitter user possesses an Excel macro for a username, it will not be properly sanitized when exported to a CSV file. This can result in remote code execution for the attacker.",
