	"description": "A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data. *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.",
