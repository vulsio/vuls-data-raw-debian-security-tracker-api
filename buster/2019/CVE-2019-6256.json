It can cause an RTSPServer crash in handleHTTPCmd_TunnelingPOST, when RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling is supported, via x-sessioncookie HTTP headers in a GET request and a POST request within the same TCP session. This occurs because of a call to an incorrect virtual function pointer in the readSocket function in GroupsockHelper.cpp.",
