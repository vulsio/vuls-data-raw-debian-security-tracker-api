	"id": "CVE-2019-5059",
	"description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.",
