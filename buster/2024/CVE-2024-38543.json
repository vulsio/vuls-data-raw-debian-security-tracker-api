	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  lib/test_hmm.c: handle src_pfns and dst_pfns allocation failure  The kcalloc() in dmirror_device_evict_chunk() will return null if the physical memory has run out.  As a result, if src_pfns or dst_pfns is dereferenced, the null pointer dereference bug will happen.  Moreover, the device is going away.  If the kcalloc() fails, the pages mapping a chunk could not be evicted.  So add a __GFP_NOFAIL flag in kcalloc().  Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory, Switch kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid failing allocations.",
