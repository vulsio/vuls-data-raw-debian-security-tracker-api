	"id": "CVE-2024-35819",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  soc: fsl: qbman: Use raw spinlock for cgr_lock  smp_call_function always runs its callback in hard IRQ context, even on PREEMPT_RT, where spinlocks can sleep. So we need to use a raw spinlock for cgr_lock to ensure we aren't waiting on a sleeping task.  Although this bug has existed for a while, it was not apparent until commit ef2a8d5478b9 (\"net: dpaa: Adjust queue depth on rate change\") which invokes smp_call_function_single via qman_update_cgr_safe every time a link goes up or down.",
