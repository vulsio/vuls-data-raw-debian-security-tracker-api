	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dm-integrity: fix a memory leak when rechecking the data  Memory for the \"checksums\" pointer will leak if the data is rechecked after checksum failure (because the associated kfree won't happen due to 'goto skip_io').  Fix this by freeing the checksums memory before recheck, and just use the \"checksum_onstack\" memory for storing checksum during recheck.",
