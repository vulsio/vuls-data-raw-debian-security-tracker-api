	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: i801: Fix block process call transactions  According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before reading the incoming data from the buffer.  The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the wrong portion of the block buffer to be read.",
