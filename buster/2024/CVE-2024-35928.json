	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/amdgpu: Fix potential ioremap() memory leaks in amdgpu_device_init()  This ensures that the memory mapped by ioremap for adev->rmmio, is properly handled in amdgpu_device_init(). If the function exits early due to an error, the memory is unmapped. If the function completes successfully, the memory remains mapped.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.c:4337 amdgpu_device_init() warn: 'adev->rmmio' from ioremap() not released on lines: 4035,4045,4051,4058,4068,4337",
