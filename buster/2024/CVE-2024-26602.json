	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier  On some systems, sys_membarrier can be very expensive, causing overall slowdowns for everything.  So put a lock on the path in order to serialize the accesses to prevent the ability for this to be called at too high of a frequency and saturate the machine.",
