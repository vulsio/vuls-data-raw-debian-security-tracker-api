	"id": "CVE-2024-32487",
	"description": "less through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation typically requires use with attacker-controlled file names, such as the files extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation also requires the LESSOPEN environment variable, but this is set by default in many common cases.",
