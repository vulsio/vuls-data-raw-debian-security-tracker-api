	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ubifs: Set page uptodate in the correct place  Page cache reads are lockless, so setting the freshly allocated page uptodate before we've overwritten it with the data it's supposed to have in it will allow a simultaneous reader to see old data.  Move the call to SetPageUptodate into ubifs_write_end(), which is after we copied the new data into the page.",
