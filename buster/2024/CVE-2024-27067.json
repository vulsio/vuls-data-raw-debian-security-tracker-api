	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/evtchn: avoid WARN() when unbinding an event channel  When unbinding a user event channel, the related handler might be called a last time in case the kernel was built with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. This might cause a WARN() in the handler.  Avoid that by adding an \"unbinding\" flag to struct user_event which will short circuit the handler.",
