	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Send DTBCLK disable message on first commit  [Why] Previous patch to allow DTBCLK disable didn't address boot case. Driver thinks DTBCLK is disabled by default, so we don't send disable message to PMFW. DTBCLK is then enabled at idle desktop on boot, burning power.  [How] Set dtbclk_en to true on boot so that disable message is sent during first commit.",
