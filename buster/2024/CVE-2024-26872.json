	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/srpt: Do not register event handler until srpt device is fully setup  Upon rare occasions, KASAN reports a use-after-free Write in srpt_refresh_port().  This seems to be because an event handler is registered before the srpt device is fully setup and a race condition upon error may leave a partially setup event handler in place.  Instead, only register the event handler after srpt device initialization is complete.",
