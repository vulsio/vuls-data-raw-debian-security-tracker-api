	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe  p2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It guards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel rescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock when PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan locks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices call p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again. Hence the deadlock.  To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar(). Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources() for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(), refer the cache and return to the caller.  Before operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check that its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH specifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices at the same DEVFN.  Tested-by Klara Modin <klarasmodin@gmail.com>",
