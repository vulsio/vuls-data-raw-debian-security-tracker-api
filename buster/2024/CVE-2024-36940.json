	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: core: delete incorrect free in pinctrl_enable()  The \"pctldev\" struct is allocated in devm_pinctrl_register_and_init(). It's a devm_ managed pointer that is freed by devm_pinctrl_dev_release(), so freeing it in pinctrl_enable() will lead to a double free.  The devm_pinctrl_dev_release() function frees the pindescs and destroys the mutex as well.",
