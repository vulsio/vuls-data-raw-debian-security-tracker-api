	"description": "Buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf_string function in tiff2pdf in libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with a DocumentName tag that contains UTF-8 characters, which triggers the overflow when a character is sign extended to an integer that produces more digits than expected in an sprintf call.",
