	"id": "CVE-2020-28049",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in SDDM before 0.19.0. It incorrectly starts the X server in a way that - for a short time period - allows local unprivileged users to create a connection to the X server without providing proper authentication. A local attacker can thus access X server display contents and, for example, intercept keystrokes or access the clipboard. This is caused by a race condition during Xauthority file creation.",
