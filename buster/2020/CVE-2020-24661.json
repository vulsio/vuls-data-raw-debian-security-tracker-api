	"id": "CVE-2020-24661",
	"description": "GNOME Geary before 3.36.3 mishandles pinned TLS certificate verification for IMAP and SMTP services using invalid TLS certificates (e.g., self-signed certificates) when the client system is not configured to use a system-provided PKCS#11 store. This allows a meddler in the middle to present a different invalid certificate to intercept incoming and outgoing mail.",
