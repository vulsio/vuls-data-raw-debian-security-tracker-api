	"id": "CVE-2025-21695",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86: dell-uart-backlight: fix serdev race  The dell_uart_bl_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open() before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.  This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1 (\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition\") where devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the device.  Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via devm_serdev_device_open().  Note, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control() calls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call.",
