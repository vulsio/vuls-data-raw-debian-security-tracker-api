	"id": "CVE-2025-21655",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/eventfd: ensure io_eventfd_signal() defers another RCU period  io_eventfd_do_signal() is invoked from an RCU callback, but when dropping the reference to the io_ev_fd, it calls io_eventfd_free() directly if the refcount drops to zero. This isn't correct, as any potential freeing of the io_ev_fd should be deferred another RCU grace period.  Just call io_eventfd_put() rather than open-code the dec-and-test and free, which will correctly defer it another RCU grace period.",
