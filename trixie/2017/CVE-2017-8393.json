{
	"id": "CVE-2017-8393",
	"description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a global buffer over-read error because of an assumption made by code that runs for objcopy and strip, that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections are always named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy and strip, to crash.",
