	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access  Arnd Bergmann sent a patch to fsdevel, he says:  \"orangefs_statfs() copies two consecutive fields of the superblock into the statfs structure, which triggers a warning from the string fortification helpers\"  Jan Kara suggested an alternate way to do the patch to make it more readable.  I ran both ideas through xfstests and both seem fine. This patch is based on Jan Kara's suggestion.",
