	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush  In terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty. And if an application does overflow a bit, it'll have a few entries. However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case that generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can take quite a while.  Check for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and do so if necessary. There's no state to maintain here as overflows always prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquire the locks at the end of the loop.",
