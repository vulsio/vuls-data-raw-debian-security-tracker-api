	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref()  The add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the \"name\" struct when it is declared.  If any of the following calls to \"read_one_inode() returns NULL,  \tdir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid); \tif (!dir) { \t\tret = -ENOENT; \t\tgoto out; \t}  \tinode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid); \tif (!inode) { \t\tret = -EIO; \t\tgoto out; \t}  then \"name.name\" would be freed on \"out\" before being initialized.  out: \t... \tkfree(name.name);  This issue was reported by Coverity with CID 1526744.",
