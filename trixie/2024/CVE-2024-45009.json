	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ req  Adding the following warning ...    WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)  ... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find a bug when running the \"remove single subflow\" subtest from the mptcp_join.sh selftest.  Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then the subflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of the RM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement this add_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows have not been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.  A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attached subflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated by the host receiving the RM_ADDR.",
