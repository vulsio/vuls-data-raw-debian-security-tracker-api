	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()  Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.  This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.  This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.  Rule: add",
