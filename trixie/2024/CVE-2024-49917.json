	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for clk_mgr and clk_mgr->funcs in dcn30_init_hw  This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn30_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` or `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is not null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential null pointer dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:789 dcn30_init_hw() error: we previously assumed 'dc->clk_mgr' could be null (see line 628)",
