	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtw88: always wait for both firmware loading attempts  In 'rtw_wait_firmware_completion()', always wait for both (regular and wowlan) firmware loading attempts. Otherwise if 'rtw_usb_intf_init()' has failed in 'rtw_usb_probe()', 'rtw_usb_disconnect()' may issue 'ieee80211_free_hw()' when one of 'rtw_load_firmware_cb()' (usually the wowlan one) is still in progress, causing UAF detected by KASAN.",
