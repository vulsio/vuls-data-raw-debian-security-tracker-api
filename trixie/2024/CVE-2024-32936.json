	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: ti: j721e-csi2rx: Fix races while restarting DMA  After the frame is submitted to DMA, it may happen that the submitted list is not updated soon enough, and the DMA callback is triggered before that.  This can lead to kernel crashes, so move everything in a single lock/unlock section to prevent such races.",
