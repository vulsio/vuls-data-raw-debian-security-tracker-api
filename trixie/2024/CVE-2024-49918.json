	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add null check for head_pipe in dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer  This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer` function. The issue could occur when `head_pipe` is null.  The fix adds a check to ensure `head_pipe` is not null before asserting it. If `head_pipe` is null, the function returns NULL to prevent a potential null pointer dereference.  Reported by smatch: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn32/dcn32_resource.c:2690 dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer() error: we previously assumed 'head_pipe' could be null (see line 2681)",
