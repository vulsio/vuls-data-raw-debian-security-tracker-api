	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/hugetlb: fix memfd_pin_folios free_huge_pages leak  memfd_pin_folios followed by unpin_folios fails to restore free_huge_pages if the pages were not already faulted in, because the folio refcount for pages created by memfd_alloc_folio never goes to 0.  memfd_pin_folios needs another folio_put to undo the folio_try_get below:  memfd_alloc_folio()   alloc_hugetlb_folio_nodemask()     dequeue_hugetlb_folio_nodemask()       dequeue_hugetlb_folio_node_exact()         folio_ref_unfreeze(folio, 1);    ; adds 1 refcount   folio_try_get()                        ; adds 1 refcount   hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()            ; adds 512 refcount (on x86)  With the fix, after memfd_pin_folios + unpin_folios, the refcount for the (unfaulted) page is 512, which is correct, as the refcount for a faulted unpinned page is 513.",
