	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Possible null pointer dereference in cs35l41_hda_unbind()  The cs35l41_hda_unbind() function clears the hda_component entry matching it's index and then dereferences the codec pointer held in the first element of the hda_component array, this is an issue when the device index was 0.  Instead use the codec pointer stashed in the cs35l41_hda structure as it will still be valid.",
