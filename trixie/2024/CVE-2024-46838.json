	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  userfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table  Since khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in file mappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - get rid of them.  We could also remove the preceding \"if (unlikely(...))\" block, but then we could reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file mappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be fine but I think is not necessarily expected.",
