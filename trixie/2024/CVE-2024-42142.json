	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: E-switch, Create ingress ACL when needed  Currently, ingress acl is used for three features. It is created only when vport metadata match and prio tag are enabled. But active-backup lag mode also uses it. It is independent of vport metadata match and prio tag. And vport metadata match can be disabled using the following devlink command:   # devlink dev param set pci/0000:08:00.0 name esw_port_metadata \\ \tvalue false cmode runtime  If ingress acl is not created, will hit panic when creating drop rule for active-backup lag mode. If always create it, there will be about 5% performance degradation.  Fix it by creating ingress acl when needed. If esw_port_metadata is true, ingress acl exists, then create drop rule using existing ingress acl. If esw_port_metadata is false, create ingress acl and then create drop rule.",
