	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: rtw89: Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()  In rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() 'status->he_gi' is compared to array size. But then 'rate->he_gi' is used as array index instead of 'status->he_gi'. This can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of 'rate->he_gi' is not equal to 'status->he_gi' and is bigger than array size. Looks like \"copy-paste\" mistake.  Fix this mistake by replacing 'rate->he_gi' with 'status->he_gi'.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
