	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Release hbalock before calling lpfc_worker_wake_up()  lpfc_worker_wake_up() calls the lpfc_work_done() routine, which takes the hbalock.  Thus, lpfc_worker_wake_up() should not be called while holding the hbalock to avoid potential deadlock.",
