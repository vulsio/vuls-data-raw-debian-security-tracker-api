	"id": "CVE-2024-44996",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vsock: fix recursive ->recvmsg calls  After a vsock socket has been added to a BPF sockmap, its prot->recvmsg has been replaced with vsock_bpf_recvmsg(). Thus the following recursiion could happen:  vsock_bpf_recvmsg()  -> __vsock_recvmsg()   -> vsock_connectible_recvmsg()    -> prot->recvmsg()     -> vsock_bpf_recvmsg() again  We need to fix it by calling the original ->recvmsg() without any BPF sockmap logic in __vsock_recvmsg().",
