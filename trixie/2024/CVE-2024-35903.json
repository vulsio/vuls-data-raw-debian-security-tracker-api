	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/bpf: Fix IP after emitting call depth accounting  Adjust the IP passed to `emit_patch` so it calculates the correct offset for the CALL instruction if `x86_call_depth_emit_accounting` emits code. Otherwise we will skip some instructions and most likely crash.",
