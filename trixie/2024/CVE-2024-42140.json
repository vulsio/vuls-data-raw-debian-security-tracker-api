	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: kexec: Avoid deadlock in kexec crash path  If the kexec crash code is called in the interrupt context, the machine_kexec_mask_interrupts() function will trigger a deadlock while trying to acquire the irqdesc spinlock and then deactivate irqchip in irq_set_irqchip_state() function.  Unlike arm64, riscv only requires irq_eoi handler to complete EOI and keeping irq_set_irqchip_state() will only leave this possible deadlock without any use. So we simply remove it.",
