	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: pm: fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations  'local_addr_used' and 'add_addr_accepted' are decremented for addresses not related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source and destination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the beginning: they don't count as \"additional local address being used\" or \"ADD_ADDR being accepted\".  It is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used by the initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Without this modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added more than once.",
