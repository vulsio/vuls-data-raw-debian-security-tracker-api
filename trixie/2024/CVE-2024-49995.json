	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tipc: guard against string buffer overrun  Smatch reports that copying media_name and if_name to name_parts may overwrite the destination.   .../bearer.c:166 bearer_name_validate() error: strcpy() 'media_name' too large for 'name_parts->media_name' (32 vs 16)  .../bearer.c:167 bearer_name_validate() error: strcpy() 'if_name' too large for 'name_parts->if_name' (1010102 vs 16)  This does seem to be the case so guard against this possibility by using strscpy() and failing if truncation occurs.  Introduced by commit b97bf3fd8f6a (\"[TIPC] Initial merge\")  Compile tested only.",
