	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: use memtostr_pad() for s_volume_name  As with the other strings in struct ext4_super_block, s_volume_name is not NUL terminated. The other strings were marked in commit 072ebb3bffe6 (\"ext4: add nonstring annotations to ext4.h\"). Using strscpy() isn't the right replacement for strncpy(); it should use memtostr_pad() instead.",
