	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mmc: sdhci-msm: pervent access to suspended controller  Generic sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended flag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesn't set this flag, which causes a crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime suspended. Fix this by setting the flag correctly.",
