	"id": "CVE-2024-31143",
	"description": "An optional feature of PCI MSI called \"Multiple Message\" allows a device to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors.  Unlike for MSI-X, the setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one go.  In this handling an error path could be taken in different situations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error path wrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.",
