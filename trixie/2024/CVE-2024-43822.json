	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoc: PCM6240: Return directly after a failed devm_kzalloc() in pcmdevice_i2c_probe()  The value “-ENOMEM” was assigned to the local variable “ret” in one if branch after a devm_kzalloc() call failed at the beginning. This error code will trigger then a pcmdevice_remove() call with a passed null pointer so that an undesirable dereference will be performed. Thus return the appropriate error code directly.",
