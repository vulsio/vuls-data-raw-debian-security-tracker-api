	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using dc->clk_mgr  [WHY & HOW] dc->clk_mgr is null checked previously in the same function, indicating it might be null.  Passing \"dc\" to \"dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations\", which dereferences null \"dc->clk_mgr\". (The function pointer resolves to \"dcn35_apply_idle_power_optimizations\".)  This fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.",
