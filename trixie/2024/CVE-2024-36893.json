	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: tcpm: Check for port partner validity before consuming it  typec_register_partner() does not guarantee partner registration to always succeed. In the event of failure, port->partner is set to the error value or NULL. Given that port->partner validity is not checked, this results in the following crash:  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address xx  pc : run_state_machine+0x1bc8/0x1c08  lr : run_state_machine+0x1b90/0x1c08 ..
