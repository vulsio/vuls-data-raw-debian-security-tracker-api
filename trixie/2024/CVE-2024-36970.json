	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: Use request_module_nowait  This appears to work around a deadlock regression that came in with the LED merge in 6.9.  The deadlock happens on my system with 24 iwlwifi radios, so maybe it something like all worker threads are busy and some work that needs to complete cannot complete.  [also remove unnecessary \"load_module\" var and now-wrong comment]",
