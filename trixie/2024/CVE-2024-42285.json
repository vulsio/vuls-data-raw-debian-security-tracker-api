	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs  iw_conn_req_handler() associates a new struct rdma_id_private (conn_id) with an existing struct iw_cm_id (cm_id) as follows:          conn_id->cm_id.iw = cm_id;         cm_id->context = conn_id;         cm_id->cm_handler = cma_iw_handler;  rdma_destroy_id() frees both the cm_id and the struct rdma_id_private. Make sure that cm_work_handler() does not trigger a use-after-free by only freeing of the struct rdma_id_private after all pending work has finished.",
