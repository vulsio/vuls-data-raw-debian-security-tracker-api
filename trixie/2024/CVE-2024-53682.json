	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  regulator: axp20x: AXP717: set ramp_delay  AXP717 datasheet says that regulator ramp delay is 15.625 us/step, which is 10mV in our case.  Add a AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC_RANGES macro to expand to AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0  For DCDC4, steps is 100mv  Add a AXP_DESC_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC macro to expand to AXP_DESC_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0  This patch fix crashes when using CPU DVFS.",
