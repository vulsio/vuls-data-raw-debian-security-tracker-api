	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2830: fix an out-of-bounds write error  Ensure index in rtl2830_pid_filter does not exceed 31 to prevent out-of-bounds access.  dev->filters is a 32-bit value, so set_bit and clear_bit functions should only operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32, it will attempt to access a non-existent 33rd bit, leading to out-of-bounds access. Change the boundary check from index > 32 to index >= 32 to resolve this issue.",
