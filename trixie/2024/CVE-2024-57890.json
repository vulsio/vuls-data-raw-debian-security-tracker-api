	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue  In the expression \"cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count\", both variables are u32 values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer wrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap.  The \"cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)\" multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on 64bit systems.  This patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable \"len\" is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.",
