	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: cfg80211: check A-MSDU format more carefully  If it looks like there's another subframe in the A-MSDU but the header isn't fully there, we can end up reading data out of bounds, only to discard later. Make this a bit more careful and check if the subframe header can even be present.",
