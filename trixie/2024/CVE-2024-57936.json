	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix max SGEs for the Work Request  Gen P7 supports up to 13 SGEs for now. WQE software structure can hold only 6 now. Since the max send sge is reported as 13, the stack can give requests up to 13 SGEs. This is causing traffic failures and system crashes.  Use the define for max SGE supported for variable size. This will work for both static and variable WQEs.",
