	"description": "phpLDAPadmin since at least version 1.2.0 through the latest version 1.2.6.7 allows users to export elements from the LDAP directory into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product. Thus, this could lead to CSV Formula Injection.",
