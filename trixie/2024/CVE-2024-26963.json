	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior  As runtime PM is enabled, the module can be runtime suspended when .remove() is called.  Do a pm_runtime_get_sync() to make sure module is active before doing any register operations.  Doing a pm_runtime_put_sync() should disable the refclk so no need to disable it again.  Fixes the below warning at module removel.  [   39.705310] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [   39.710004] clk:162:3 already disabled [   39.713941] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 921 at drivers/clk/clk.c:1090 clk_core_disable+0xb0/0xb8  We called of_platform_populate() in .probe() so call the cleanup function of_platform_depopulate() in .remove(). Get rid of the now unnnecessary dwc3_ti_remove_core(). Without this, module re-load doesn't work properly.",
