	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fsl/fman: Fix refcount handling of fman-related devices  In mac_probe() there are multiple calls to of_find_device_by_node(), fman_bind() and fman_port_bind() which takes references to of_dev->dev. Not all references taken by these calls are released later on error path in mac_probe() and in mac_remove() which lead to reference leaks.  Add references release.",
