	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: fsl-qdma: fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read  There is chip (ls1028a) errata:  The SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read transactions by QDMA.  Unaligned read transactions initiated by QDMA may stall in the NOC (Network On-Chip), causing a deadlock condition. Stalled transactions will trigger completion timeouts in PCIe controller.  Workaround: Enable prefetch by setting the source descriptor prefetchable bit ( SD[PF] = 1 ).  Implement this workaround.",
