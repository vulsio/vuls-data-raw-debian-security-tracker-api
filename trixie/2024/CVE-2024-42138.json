	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mlxsw: core_linecards: Fix double memory deallocation in case of invalid INI file  In case of invalid INI file mlxsw_linecard_types_init() deallocates memory but doesn't reset pointer to NULL and returns 0. In case of any error occurred after mlxsw_linecard_types_init() call, mlxsw_linecards_init() calls mlxsw_linecard_types_fini() which performs memory deallocation again.  Add pointer reset to NULL.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
