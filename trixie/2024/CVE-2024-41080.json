	"id": "CVE-2024-41080",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()  The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(), which acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock. Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (\"io_uring: drop ctx->uring_lock before acquiring sqd->lock\"), this can lead to a potential deadlock situation.  To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.  This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.",
