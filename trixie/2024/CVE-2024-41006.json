	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netrom: Fix a memory leak in nr_heartbeat_expiry()  syzbot reported a memory leak in nr_create() [0].  Commit 409db27e3a2e (\"netrom: Fix use-after-free of a listening socket.\") added sock_hold() to the nr_heartbeat_expiry() function, where a) a socket has a SOCK_DESTROY flag or b) a listening socket has a SOCK_DEAD flag.  But in the case \"a,\" when the SOCK_DESTROY flag is set, the file descriptor has already been closed and the nr_release() function has been called. So it makes no sense to hold the reference count because no one will call another nr_destroy_socket() and put it as in the case \"b.\"  nr_connect   nr_establish_data_link     nr_start_heartbeat  nr_release   switch (nr->state)   case NR_STATE_3     nr->state = NR_STATE_2     sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY);                          nr_rx_frame                           nr_process_rx_frame                             switch (nr->state)                             case NR_STATE_2                               nr_state2_machine()                                 nr_disconnect()                                   nr_sk(sk)->state = NR_STATE_0                                   sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD)                          nr_heartbeat_expiry                           switch (nr->state)                           case NR_STATE_0                             if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY) ||                                (sk->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN                                  && sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD)))                                sock_hold()  // ( !!! )                                nr_destroy_socket()  To fix the memory leak, let's call sock_hold() only for a listening socket.
