	"id": "CVE-2024-42318",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer  When a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokes the cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (when KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), the cred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements the cred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes all information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.  This basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork() and keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on itself.  Fix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the existing cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare() call hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to accidentally diverge in the future.)",
