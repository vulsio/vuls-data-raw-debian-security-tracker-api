	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  phy: rockchip: samsung-hdptx: Set drvdata before enabling runtime PM  In some cases, rk_hdptx_phy_runtime_resume() may be invoked before platform_set_drvdata() is executed in ->probe(), leading to a NULL pointer dereference when using the return of dev_get_drvdata().  Ensure platform_set_drvdata() is called before devm_pm_runtime_enable().",
