	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/tcp_ao: Don't leak ao_info on error-path  It seems I introduced it together with TCP_AO_CMDF_AO_REQUIRED, on version 5 [1] of TCP-AO patches. Quite frustrative that having all these selftests that I've written, running kmemtest & kcov was always in todo.  [1]: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20230215183335.800122-5-dima@arista.com/",
