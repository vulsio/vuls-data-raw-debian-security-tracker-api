	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  EDAC/bluefield: Fix potential integer overflow  The 64-bit argument for the \"get DIMM info\" SMC call consists of mem_ctrl_idx left-shifted 16 bits and OR-ed with DIMM index.  With mem_ctrl_idx defined as 32-bits wide the left-shift operation truncates the upper 16 bits of information during the calculation of the SMC argument.  The mem_ctrl_idx stack variable must be defined as 64-bits wide to prevent any potential integer overflow, i.e. loss of data from upper 16 bits.",
