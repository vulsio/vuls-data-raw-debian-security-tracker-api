	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: Fix sleeping in invalid context in die()  die() can be called in exception handler, and therefore cannot sleep. However, die() takes spinlock_t which can sleep with PREEMPT_RT enabled. That causes the following warning:  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48 in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 285, name: mutex preempt_count: 110001, expected: 0 RCU nest depth: 0, expected: 0 CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 285 Comm: mutex Not tainted 6.12.0-rc7-00022-ge19049cf7d56-dirty #234 Hardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT) Call Trace:     dump_backtrace+0x1c/0x24     show_stack+0x2c/0x38     dump_stack_lvl+0x5a/0x72     dump_stack+0x14/0x1c     __might_resched+0x130/0x13a     rt_spin_lock+0x2a/0x5c     die+0x24/0x112     do_trap_insn_illegal+0xa0/0xea     _new_vmalloc_restore_context_a0+0xcc/0xd8 Oops - illegal instruction [#1]  Switch to use raw_spinlock_t, which does not sleep even with PREEMPT_RT enabled.",
