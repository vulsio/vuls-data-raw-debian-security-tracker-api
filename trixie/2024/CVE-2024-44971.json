	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix a possible memory leak in bcm_sf2_mdio_register()  bcm_sf2_mdio_register() calls of_phy_find_device() and then phy_device_remove() in a loop to remove existing PHY devices. of_phy_find_device() eventually calls bus_find_device(), which calls get_device() on the returned struct device * to increment the refcount. The current implementation does not decrement the refcount, which causes memory leak.  This commit adds the missing phy_device_free() call to decrement the refcount via put_device() to balance the refcount.",
