	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal  Binding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic because on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this by avoiding the device-managed LED functions.  Note: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED even if registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detects this and is a no-op in this case.",
