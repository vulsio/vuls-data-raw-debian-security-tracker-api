	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: correctly handle malformed BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL relos  In case of malformed relocation record of kind BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL referencing a non-existing BTF type, function bpf_core_calc_relo_insn would cause a null pointer deference.  Fix this by adding a proper check upper in call stack, as malformed relocation records could be passed from user space.  Simplest reproducer is a program:      r0 = 0     exit  With a single relocation record:      .insn_off = 0,          /* patch first instruction */     .type_id = 100500,      /* this type id does not exist */     .access_str_off = 6,    /* offset of string \"0\" */     .kind = BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL,  See the link for original reproducer or next commit for a test case.",
