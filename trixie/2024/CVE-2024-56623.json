	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: qla2xxx: Fix use after free on unload  System crash is observed with stack trace warning of use after free. There are 2 signals to tell dpc_thread to terminate (UNLOADING flag and kthread_stop).  On setting the UNLOADING flag when dpc_thread happens to run at the time and sees the flag, this causes dpc_thread to exit and clean up itself. When kthread_stop is called for final cleanup, this causes use after free.  Remove UNLOADING signal to terminate dpc_thread.  Use the kthread_stop as the main signal to exit dpc_thread.
