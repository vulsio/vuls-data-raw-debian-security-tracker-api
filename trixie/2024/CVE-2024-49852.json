	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: elx: libefc: Fix potential use after free in efc_nport_vport_del()  The kref_put() function will call nport->release if the refcount drops to zero.  The nport->release release function is _efc_nport_free() which frees \"nport\".  But then we dereference \"nport\" on the next line which is a use after free.  Re-order these lines to avoid the use after free.",
