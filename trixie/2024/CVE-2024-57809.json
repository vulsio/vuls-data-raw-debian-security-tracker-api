	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: imx6: Fix suspend/resume support on i.MX6QDL  The suspend/resume functionality is currently broken on the i.MX6QDL platform, as documented in the NXP errata (ERR005723):    https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdf  This patch addresses the issue by sharing most of the suspend/resume sequences used by other i.MX devices, while avoiding modifications to critical registers that disrupt the PCIe functionality. It targets the same problem as the following downstream commit:    https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995  Unlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe device if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k or iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the driver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with existing practices.  Upon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an example of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:    ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible   Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944  Without this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a PCIe device is connected.
