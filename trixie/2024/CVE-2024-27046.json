	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfp: flower: handle acti_netdevs allocation failure  The kmalloc_array() in nfp_fl_lag_do_work() will return null, if the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference the acti_netdevs, the null pointer dereference bugs will happen.  This patch adds a check to judge whether allocation failure occurs. If it happens, the delayed work will be rescheduled and try again.",
