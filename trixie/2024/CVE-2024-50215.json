	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvmet-auth: assign dh_key to NULL after kfree_sensitive  ctrl->dh_key might be used across multiple calls to nvmet_setup_dhgroup() for the same controller. So it's better to nullify it after release on error path in order to avoid double free later in nvmet_destroy_auth().  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Svace.",
