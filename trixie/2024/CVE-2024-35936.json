	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: handle chunk tree lookup error in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks()  The unhandled case in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption, as it could be caused only by two impossible conditions:  - at first the search key is set up to look for a chunk tree item, with   offset -1, this is an inexact search and the key->offset will contain   the correct offset upon a successful search, a valid chunk tree item   cannot have an offset -1  - after first successful search, the found_key corresponds to a chunk   item, the offset is decremented by 1 before the next loop, it's   impossible to find a chunk item there due to alignment and size   constraints",
