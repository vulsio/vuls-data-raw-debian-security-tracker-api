	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: v4l: async: Fix notifier list entry init  struct v4l2_async_notifier has several list_head members, but only waiting_list and done_list are initialized. notifier_entry was kept 'zeroed' leading to an uninitialized list_head. This results in a NULL-pointer dereference if csi2_async_register() fails, e.g. node for remote endpoint is disabled, and returns -ENOTCONN. The following calls to v4l2_async_nf_unregister() results in a NULL pointer dereference. Add the missing list head initializer.",
