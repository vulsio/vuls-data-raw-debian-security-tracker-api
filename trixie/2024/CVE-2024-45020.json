	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()  Daniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext. Further investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access in stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:      if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&         old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=         cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])             return false;  The 'i' iterates old->allocated_stack. If cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound access will happen.  To fix the issue add 'i >= cur->allocated_stack' check such that if the condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise, cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.",
