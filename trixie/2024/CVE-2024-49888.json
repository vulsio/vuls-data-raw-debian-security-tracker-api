	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix a sdiv overflow issue  Zac Ecob reported a problem where a bpf program may cause kernel crash due to the following error:   Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI  The failure is due to the below signed divide:   LLONG_MIN/-1 where LLONG_MIN equals to -9,223,372,036,854,775,808. LLONG_MIN/-1 is supposed to give a positive number 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, but it is impossible since for 64-bit system, the maximum positive number is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. On x86_64, LLONG_MIN/-1 will cause a kernel exception. On arm64, the result for LLONG_MIN/-1 is LLONG_MIN.  Further investigation found all the following sdiv/smod cases may trigger an exception when bpf program is running on x86_64 platform:   - LLONG_MIN/-1 for 64bit operation   - INT_MIN/-1 for 32bit operation   - LLONG_MIN%-1 for 64bit operation   - INT_MIN%-1 for 32bit operation where -1 can be an immediate or in a register.  On arm64, there are no exceptions:   - LLONG_MIN/-1 = LLONG_MIN   - INT_MIN/-1 = INT_MIN   - LLONG_MIN%-1 = 0   - INT_MIN%-1 = 0 where -1 can be an immediate or in a register.  Insn patching is needed to handle the above cases and the patched codes produced results aligned with above arm64 result. The below are pseudo codes to handle sdiv/smod exceptions including both divisor -1 and divisor 0 and the divisor is stored in a register.  sdiv:       tmp = rX       tmp += 1 /* [-1, 0] -> [0, 1]       if tmp >(unsigned) 1 goto L2       if tmp == 0 goto L1       rY = 0   L1:       rY = -rY;       goto L3   L2:       rY /= rX   L3:  smod:       tmp = rX       tmp += 1 /* [-1, 0] -> [0, 1]       if tmp >(unsigned) 1 goto L1       if tmp == 1 (is64 ? goto L2 : goto L3)       rY = 0;       goto L2   L1:       rY %= rX   L2:       goto L4  // only when !is64   L3:       wY = wY  // only when !is64   L4:    [1] https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/tPJLTEh7S_DxFEqAI2Ji5MBSoZVg7_G-Py2iaZpAaWtM961fFTWtsnlzwvTbzBzaUzwQAoNATXKUlt0LZOFgnDcIyKCswAnAGdUF3LBrhGQ=@protonmail.com/",
