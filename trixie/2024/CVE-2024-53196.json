	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: arm64: Don't retire aborted MMIO instruction  Returning an abort to the guest for an unsupported MMIO access is a documented feature of the KVM UAPI. Nevertheless, it's clear that this plumbing has seen limited testing, since userspace can trivially cause a WARN in the MMIO return:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 30558 at arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h:536 kvm_handle_mmio_return+0x46c/0x5c4 arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h:536   Call trace:    kvm_handle_mmio_return+0x46c/0x5c4 arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h:536    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x98/0x15b4 arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c:1133    kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x75c/0xa78 virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4487    __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]    __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:893 [inline]    __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x14c/0x1c8 fs/ioctl.c:893    __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:35 [inline]    invoke_syscall+0x98/0x2b8 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49    el0_svc_common+0x1e0/0x23c arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:132    do_el0_svc+0x48/0x58 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:151    el0_svc+0x38/0x68 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:712    el0t_64_sync_handler+0x90/0xfc arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:730    el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:598  The splat is complaining that KVM is advancing PC while an exception is pending, i.e. that KVM is retiring the MMIO instruction despite a pending synchronous external abort. Womp womp.  Fix the glaring UAPI bug by skipping over all the MMIO emulation in case there is a pending synchronous exception. Note that while userspace is capable of pending an asynchronous exception (SError, IRQ, or FIQ), it is still safe to retire the MMIO instruction in this case as (1) they are by definition asynchronous, and (2) KVM relies on hardware support for pending/delivering these exceptions instead of the software state machine for advancing PC.",
