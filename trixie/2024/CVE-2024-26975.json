	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereference  A NULL pointer dereference is triggered when probing the MMIO RAPL driver on platforms with CPU ID not listed in intel_rapl_common CPU model list.  This is because the intel_rapl_common module still probes on such platforms even if 'defaults_msr' is not set after commit 1488ac990ac8 (\"powercap: intel_rapl: Allow probing without CPUID match\"). Thus the MMIO RAPL rp->priv->defaults is NULL when registering to RAPL framework.  Fix the problem by adding sanity check to ensure rp->priv->rapl_defaults is always valid.",
