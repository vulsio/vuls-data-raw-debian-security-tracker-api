	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect  Commit 9d7b18668956 (\"HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple Magic Trackpad 2\") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned success instead of -ENODEV when the check failed. This means that the remove callback will dereference the never-initialised driver data pointer when the driver is later unbound (e.g. on USB disconnect).",
