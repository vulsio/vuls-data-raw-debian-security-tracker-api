	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ataflop: potential out of bounds in do_format()  The function uses \"type\" as an array index:  \tq = unit[drive].disk[type]->queue;  Unfortunately the bounds check on \"type\" isn't done until later in the function.  Fix this by moving the bounds check to the start.",
