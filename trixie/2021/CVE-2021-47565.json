	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test  While looping over shost's sdev list it is possible that one of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is freed but its sdev object remains intact.  Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the sas_target object for NULL.",
