	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit  This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel with values.  If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(), leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to fbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.  To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will \"fix and fill\" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.",
