	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location  Syzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized mutex. The problem was in wrong mutex_init() location.  Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, but dvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:  \tdvb_usbv2_init() \t  dvb_usbv2_adapter_init() \t    dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init() \t      props->frontend_attach()  \t  props->init()  Since mxl111sf_* devices call mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach() internally we need to initialize state->msg_lock before frontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() call added to all mxl111sf_* devices, which will simply initiaize mutex.",
