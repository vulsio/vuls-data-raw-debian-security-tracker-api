	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mptcp: fix data stream corruption  Maxim reported several issues when forcing a TCP transparent proxy to use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. He also provided a clean reproducer.  The problem boils down to 'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming that only MPTCP will use the given page_frag.  If others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate page fragments, we can end-up re-using already allocated memory for mptcp_data_frag.  Fix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded data fragment is located at the current page frag end.  v1 -> v2:  - added missing fixes tag (Mat)",
