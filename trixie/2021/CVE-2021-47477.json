	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: dt9812: fix DMA buffers on stack  USB transfer buffers are typically mapped for DMA and must not be allocated on the stack or transfers will fail.  Allocate proper transfer buffers in the various command helpers and return an error on short transfers instead of acting on random stack data.  Note that this also fixes a stack info leak on systems where DMA is not used as 32 bytes are always sent to the device regardless of how short the command is.",
