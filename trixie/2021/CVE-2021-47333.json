	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge  There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function. A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case, bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL. Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex. This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.
