	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mcb: fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus()  There are two bugs: 1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier)    but we haven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that    leads to a use after free. 2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to    release the bus.  This will free the internal resources tied to the    device and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.",
