	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix use-after-free in zynqmp_qspi_exec_op  When handling op->addr, it is using the buffer \"tmpbuf\" which has been freed. This will trigger a use-after-free KASAN warning. Let's use temporary variables to store op->addr.val and op->cmd.opcode to fix this issue.",
