	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen  Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE mouting an ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the trace below.  Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always null terminated.  This causes a read outside of the source string triggering the buffer overflow detection.    detected buffer overflow in strlen   ------------[ cut here ]------------   kernel BUG at lib/string.c:1149!   invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI   CPU: 1 PID: 910 Comm: mount.ocfs2 Not tainted 5.14.0-1-amd64 #1     Debian 5.14.6-2   RIP: 0010:fortify_panic+0xf/0x11   ...
