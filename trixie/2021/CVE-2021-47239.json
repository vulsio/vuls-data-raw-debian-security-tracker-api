	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: usb: fix possible use-after-free in smsc75xx_bind  The commit 46a8b29c6306 (\"net: usb: fix memory leak in smsc75xx_bind\") fails to clean up the work scheduled in smsc75xx_reset-> smsc75xx_set_multicast, which leads to use-after-free if the work is scheduled to start after the deallocation. In addition, this patch also removes a dangling pointer - dev->data[0].  This patch calls cancel_work_sync to cancel the scheduled work and set the dangling pointer to NULL.",
