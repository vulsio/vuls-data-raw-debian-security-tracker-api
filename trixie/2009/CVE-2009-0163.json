  "description": "Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, which is not properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
