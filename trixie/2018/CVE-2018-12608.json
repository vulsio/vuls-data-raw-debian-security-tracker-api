  "id": "CVE-2018-12608",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root certificate and all system roots on non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain validated certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA (as opposed to one signed by the configured CA root certificate) to authenticate.",
