  "description": "A null-pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libtirpc before version 0.3.3-rc3. The return value of makefd_xprt() was not checked in all instances, which could lead to a crash when the server exhausted the maximum number of available file descriptors. A remote attacker could cause an rpc-based application to crash by flooding it with new connections.",
