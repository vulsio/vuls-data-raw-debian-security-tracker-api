	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ieee802154: at86rf230: Stop leaking skb's  Upon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Only ieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leak the skb structure.  Free the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.  As the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of a possible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and a new interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just for this purpose.  There is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on this area and the issue kind of always existed.",
