	"id": "CVE-2022-48900",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/netfront: react properly to failing gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref()  When calling gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() the returned value must be tested and the reaction to that value should be appropriate.  In case of failure in xennet_get_responses() the reaction should not be to crash the system, but to disable the network device.  The calls in setup_netfront() can be replaced by calls of gnttab_end_foreign_access(). While at it avoid double free of ring pages and grant references via xennet_disconnect_backend() in this case.  This is CVE-2022-23042 / part of XSA-396.  --- V2: - avoid double free V3: - remove pointless initializer (Jan Beulich)",
