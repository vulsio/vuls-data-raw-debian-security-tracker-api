	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: hid-thrustmaster: fix OOB read in thrustmaster_interrupts  Syzbot reported an slab-out-of-bounds Read in thrustmaster_probe() bug. The root case is in missing validation check of actual number of endpoints.  Code should not blindly access usb_host_interface::endpoint array, since it may contain less endpoints than code expects.  Fix it by adding missing validaion check and print an error if number of endpoints do not match expected number",
