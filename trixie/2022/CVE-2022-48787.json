	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iwlwifi: fix use-after-free  If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it was freed.  Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data was already freed anyway.",
