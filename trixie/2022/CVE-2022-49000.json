	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iommu/vt-d: Fix PCI device refcount leak in has_external_pci()  for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment of pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the returned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.  If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missing pci_dev_put() before 'return true' to avoid reference count leak.",
