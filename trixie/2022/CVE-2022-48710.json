	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/radeon: fix a possible null pointer dereference  In radeon_fp_native_mode(), the return value of drm_mode_duplicate() is assigned to mode, which will lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of drm_mode_duplicate(). Add a check to avoid npd.  The failure status of drm_cvt_mode() on the other path is checked too.",
