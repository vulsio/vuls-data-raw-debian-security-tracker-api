	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: Fix wrong offset in bio_truncate()  bio_truncate() clears the buffer outside of last block of bdev, however current bio_truncate() is using the wrong offset of page. So it can return the uninitialized data.  This happened when both of truncated/corrupted FS and userspace (via bdev) are trying to read the last of bdev.",
