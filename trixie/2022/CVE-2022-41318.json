	"description": "A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6. Due to incorrect integer-overflow protection, the SSPI and SMB authentication helpers are vulnerable to reading unintended memory locations. In some configurations, cleartext credentials from these locations are sent to a client. This is fixed in 5.7.",
