	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched: Fix yet more sched_fork() races  Where commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (\"kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid sched_task_group\") fixed a fork race vs cgroup, it opened up a race vs syscalls by not placing the task on the runqueue before it gets exposed through the pidhash.  Commit 13765de8148f (\"sched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity\") is trying to fix a single instance of this, instead fix the whole class of issues, effectively reverting this commit.",
