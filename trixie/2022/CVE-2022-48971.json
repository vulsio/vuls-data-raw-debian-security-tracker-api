	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Bluetooth: Fix not cleanup led when bt_init fails  bt_init() calls bt_leds_init() to register led, but if it fails later, bt_leds_cleanup() is not called to unregister it.  This can cause panic if the argument \"bluetooth-power\" in text is freed and then another led_trigger_register() tries to access it:  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc06d3bc0 RIP: 0010:strcmp+0xc/0x30   Call Trace:     <TASK>     led_trigger_register+0x10d/0x4f0     led_trigger_register_simple+0x7d/0x100     bt_init+0x39/0xf7 [bluetooth]     do_one_initcall+0xd0/0x4e0",
