	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  selinux: fix double free of cond_list on error paths  On error path from cond_read_list() and duplicate_policydb_cond_list() the cond_list_destroy() gets called a second time in caller functions, resulting in NULL pointer deref.  Fix this by resetting the cond_list_len to 0 in cond_list_destroy(), making subsequent calls a noop.  Also consistently reset the cond_list pointer to NULL after freeing.  [PM: fix line lengths in the description]",
