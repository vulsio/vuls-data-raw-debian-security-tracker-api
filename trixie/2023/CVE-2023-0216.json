	"description": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an\napplication tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the\nd2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.\n\nThe result of the dereference is an application crash which could\nlead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL\ndoes not call this function however third party applications might\ncall these functions on untrusted data.\n\n",
