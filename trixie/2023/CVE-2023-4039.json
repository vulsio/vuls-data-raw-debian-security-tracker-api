	"id": "CVE-2023-4039",
	"description": "**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains  that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer  overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application  without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.  The default behavior when the stack-protector  detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in  controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer  overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change  program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to  go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.",
