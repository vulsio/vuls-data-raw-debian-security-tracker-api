	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pipe: wakeup wr_wait after setting max_usage  Commit c73be61cede5 (\"pipe: Add general notification queue support\") a regression was introduced that would lock up resized pipes under certain conditions. See the reproducer in [1].  The commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different function, doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actually raising pipe->max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured it would result in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write.  Set @max_usage and @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn't a watch queue.
