	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/srp: Do not call scsi_done() from srp_abort()  After scmd_eh_abort_handler() has called the SCSI LLD eh_abort_handler callback, it performs one of the following actions: * Call scsi_queue_insert(). * Call scsi_finish_command(). * Call scsi_eh_scmd_add(). Hence, SCSI abort handlers must not call scsi_done(). Otherwise all the above actions would trigger a use-after-free. Hence remove the scsi_done() call from srp_abort(). Keep the srp_free_req() call before returning SUCCESS because we may not see the command again if SUCCESS is returned.",
