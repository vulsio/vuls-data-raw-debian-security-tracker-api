	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: rsa - add a check for allocation failure  Static checkers insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add a check to prevent a NULL dereference.  Small allocations like this can't actually fail in current kernels, but adding a check is very simple and makes the static checkers happy.",
