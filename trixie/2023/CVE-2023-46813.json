	"id": "CVE-2023-46813",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable by local users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect access checking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ES emulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernel memory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a race condition through which userspace can replace an instruction before the #VC handler reads it.",
