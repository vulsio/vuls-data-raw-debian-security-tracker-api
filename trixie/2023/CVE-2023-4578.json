	"id": "CVE-2023-4578",
	"description": "When calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax` a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 117, Firefox ESR < 115.2, and Thunderbird < 115.2.",
