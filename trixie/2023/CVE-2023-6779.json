	"id": "CVE-2023-6779",
	"description": "An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when these functions are called with a message bigger than INT_MAX bytes, leading to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to store the message, resulting in an application crash. This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.",
