	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs/ntfs3: Fix an NULL dereference bug  The issue here is when this is called from ntfs_load_attr_list().  The \"size\" comes from le32_to_cpu(attr->res.data_size) so it can't overflow on a 64bit systems but on 32bit systems the \"+ 1023\" can overflow and the result is zero.  This means that the kmalloc will succeed by returning the ZERO_SIZE_PTR and then the memcpy() will crash with an Oops on the next line.",
