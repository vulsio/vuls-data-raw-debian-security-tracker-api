	"id": "CVE-2019-6799",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.8.5. When the AllowArbitraryServer configuration setting is set to true, with the use of a rogue MySQL server, an attacker can read any file on the server that the web server's user can access. This is related to the mysql.allow_local_infile PHP configuration, and the inadvertent ignoring of \"options(MYSQLI_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE\" calls.",
