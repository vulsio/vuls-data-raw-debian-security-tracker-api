	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/cma: Fix rdma_resolve_route() memory leak  Fix a memory leak when \"mda_resolve_route() is called more than once on the same \"rdma_cm_id\".  This is possible if cma_query_handler() triggers the RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_ERROR flow which puts the state machine back and allows rdma_resolve_route() to be called again.",
