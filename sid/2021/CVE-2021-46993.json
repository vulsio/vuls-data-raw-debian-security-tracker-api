	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp  Util-clamp places tasks in different buckets based on their clamp values for performance reasons. However, the size of buckets is currently computed using a rounding division, which can lead to an off-by-one error in some configurations.  For instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be 1024/20=51. A task with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id 1024/51=20. Sadly, correct indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading to an out of bound memory access.  Clamp the bucket id to fix the issue.",
