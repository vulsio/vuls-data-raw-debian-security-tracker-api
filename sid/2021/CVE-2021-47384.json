	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwmon: (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field  If driver read tmp value sufficient for (tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7)) from device then Null pointer dereference occurs. (It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where same literals mean same numbers) Also lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymore after switching to devm_i2c_new_dummy_device() in w83791d_detect_subclients().  The patch fixes possible NULL pointer dereference by removing lm75[].  Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).  [groeck: Dropped unnecessary continuation lines, fixed multi-line alignments]",
