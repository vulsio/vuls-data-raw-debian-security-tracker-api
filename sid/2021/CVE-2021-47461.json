	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap()  A race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by exit_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd_writeprotect() is called.  The race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears to be possible on vanilla kernels as well.  Use mmget_not_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd operations.",
