	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()  This condition checks \"len\" but it does not check \"offset\" and that could result in an out of bounds read if \"offset > dev->config_size\". The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the \"dev->config_size - offset\" subtraction would result in a very high unsigned value.  I think these checks might not be necessary because \"len\" and \"offset\" are supposed to already have been validated using the vhost_vdpa_config_validate() function.  But I do not know the code perfectly, and I like to be safe.",
