	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ubifs: Fix races between xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations  UBIFS may occur some problems with concurrent xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations, such as assertion failure, memory corruption, stale xattr value[1].  Fix it by importing a new rw-lock in @ubifs_inode to serilize write operations on xattr, concurrent read operations are still effective, just like ext4.
