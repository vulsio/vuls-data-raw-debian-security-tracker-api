	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: fix an incorrect limit in filelayout_decode_layout()  The \"sizeof(struct nfs_fh)\" is two bytes too large and could lead to memory corruption.  It should be NFS_MAXFHSIZE because that's the size of the ->data[] buffer.  I reversed the size of the arguments to put the variable on the left.",
