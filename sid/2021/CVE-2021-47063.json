	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach  If we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in panel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other DRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup() will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid use-after-free conditions.  v2: Cleanup connector only if it was created  v3: Add FIXME  v4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block",
