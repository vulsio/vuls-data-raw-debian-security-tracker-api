	"description": "There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the 'err_msg' of 'sqlite3_exec' is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.",
