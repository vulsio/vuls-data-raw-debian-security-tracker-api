	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFS: Fix a potential NULL dereference in nfs_get_client()  None of the callers are expecting NULL returns from nfs_get_client() so this code will lead to an Oops.  It's better to return an error pointer.  I expect that this is dead code so hopefully no one is affected.",
