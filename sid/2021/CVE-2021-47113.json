	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref  Error injection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a dangling inode ref if we failed during a rename_exchange.  This happens because we insert the inode ref for one side of the rename, and then for the other side.  If this second inode ref insert fails we'll leave the first one dangling and leave a corrupt file system behind.  Fix this by aborting if we did the insert for the first inode ref.",
