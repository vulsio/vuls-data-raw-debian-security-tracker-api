	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen/balloon: use a kernel thread instead a workqueue  Today the Xen ballooning is done via delayed work in a workqueue. This might result in workqueue hangups being reported in case of large amounts of memory are being ballooned in one go (here 16GB):  BUG: workqueue lockup - pool cpus=6 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 stuck for 64s!
