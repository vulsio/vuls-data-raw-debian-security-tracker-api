  "description": "Doctrine DBAL 3.x before 3.1.4 allows SQL Injection. The escaping of offset and length inputs to the generation of a LIMIT clause was not probably cast to an integer, allowing SQL injection to take place if application developers passed unescaped user input to the DBAL QueryBuilder or any other API that ultimately uses the AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery API.",
