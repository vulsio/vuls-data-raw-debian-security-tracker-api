	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: allow conditional reschedule for intensive iterators  If we have a lot of threads and rings, the tctx list can get quite big. This is especially true if we keep creating new threads and rings. Likewise for the provided buffers list. Be nice and insert a conditional reschedule point while iterating the nodes for deletion.",
