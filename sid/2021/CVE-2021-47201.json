	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iavf: free q_vectors before queues in iavf_disable_vf  iavf_free_queues() clears adapter->num_active_queues, which iavf_free_q_vectors() relies on, so swap the order of these two function calls in iavf_disable_vf(). This resolves a panic encountered when the interface is disabled and then later brought up again after PF communication is restored.",
