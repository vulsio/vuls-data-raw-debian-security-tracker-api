	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: pcm: oss: Fix negative period/buffer sizes  The period size calculation in OSS layer may receive a negative value as an error, but the code there assumes only the positive values and handle them with size_t.  Due to that, a too big value may be passed to the lower layers.  This patch changes the code to handle with ssize_t and adds the proper error checks appropriately.",
