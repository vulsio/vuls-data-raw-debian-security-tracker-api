	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  IB/hfi1: Fix leak of rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr  This buffer is currently allocated in hfi1_init():  \tif (reinit) \t\tret = init_after_reset(dd); \telse \t\tret = loadtime_init(dd); \tif (ret) \t\tgoto done;  \t/* allocate dummy tail memory for all receive contexts */ \tdd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr = dma_alloc_coherent(&dd->pcidev->dev, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t sizeof(u64), \t\t\t\t\t\t\t &dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_dma, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t GFP_KERNEL);  \tif (!dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr) { \t\tdd_dev_err(dd, \"cannot allocate dummy tail memory\\n\"); \t\tret = -ENOMEM; \t\tgoto done; \t}  The reinit triggered path will overwrite the old allocation and leak it.  Fix by moving the allocation to hfi1_alloc_devdata() and the deallocation to hfi1_free_devdata().",
