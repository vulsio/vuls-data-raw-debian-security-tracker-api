	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dma-buf/sync_file: Don't leak fences on merge failure  Each add_fence() call does a dma_fence_get() on the relevant fence.  In the error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences got leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren't freeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are always zero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) on every error path.",
