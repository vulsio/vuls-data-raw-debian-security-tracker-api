	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: fix use-after-free of the add_lock mutex  Commit 6098475d4cb4 (\"spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses\") introduced a per-controller mutex. But mutex_unlock() of said lock is called after the controller is already freed:    spi_unregister_controller(ctlr)   -> put_device(&ctlr->dev)     -> spi_controller_release(dev)   -> mutex_unlock(&ctrl->add_lock)  Move the put_device() after the mutex_unlock().",
