	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super  Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev(); otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.  If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't fully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were not freed and instead leaked.  This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:    systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and   systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount  ... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never gets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.",
