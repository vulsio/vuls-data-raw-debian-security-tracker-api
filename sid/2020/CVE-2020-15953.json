	"description": "LibEtPan through 1.9.4, as used in MailCore 2 through 0.6.3 and other products, has a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. When a server sends a \"begin TLS\" response, the client reads additional data (e.g., from a meddler-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka \"response injection.\"",
