	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: sprd: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails  The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on return in sprd_i2c_master_xfer() and sprd_i2c_remove().  However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a reference leak here.  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter balanced.",
