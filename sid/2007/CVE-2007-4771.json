	"description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp in libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a regular expression that writes a large amount of data to the backtracking stack.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
