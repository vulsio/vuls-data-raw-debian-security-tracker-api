	"id": "CVE-2019-15132",
	"description": "Zabbix through 4.4.0alpha1 allows User Enumeration. With login requests, it is possible to enumerate application usernames based on the variability of server responses (e.g., the \"Login name or password is incorrect\" and \"No permissions for system access\" messages, or just blocking for a number of seconds). This affects both api_jsonrpc.php and index.php.",
