	"id": "CVE-2023-34323",
	"description": "When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check the quota is correct before attempting to commit any nodes.  It would be possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node has been removed outside of the transaction.  Unfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming that the quota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it.  This will lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG (this is the default).",
