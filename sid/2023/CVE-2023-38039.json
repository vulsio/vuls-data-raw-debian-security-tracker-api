	"description": "When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so that\nthey can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API.\n\nHowever, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it would\naccept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless series\nof headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.",
