	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: s390/aes - Fix buffer overread in CTR mode  When processing the last block, the s390 ctr code will always read a whole block, even if there isn't a whole block of data left.  Fix this by using the actual length left and copy it into a buffer first for processing.",
