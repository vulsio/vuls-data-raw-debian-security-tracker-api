	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: pn533: Wait for out_urb's completion in pn533_usb_send_frame()  Fix a use-after-free that occurs in hcd when in_urb sent from pn533_usb_send_frame() is completed earlier than out_urb. Its callback frees the skb data in pn533_send_async_complete() that is used as a transfer buffer of out_urb. Wait before sending in_urb until the callback of out_urb is called. To modify the callback of out_urb alone, separate the complete function of out_urb and ack_urb.  Found by a modified version of syzkaller.
