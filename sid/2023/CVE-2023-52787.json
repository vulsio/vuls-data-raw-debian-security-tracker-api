	"id": "CVE-2023-52787",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()  blk_integrity_unregister() can come if queue usage counter isn't held for one bio with integrity prepared, so this request may be completed with calling profile->complete_fn, then kernel panic.  Another constraint is that bio_integrity_prep() needs to be called before bio merge.  Fix the issue by:  - call bio_integrity_prep() with one queue usage counter grabbed reliably  - call bio_integrity_prep() before bio merge",
