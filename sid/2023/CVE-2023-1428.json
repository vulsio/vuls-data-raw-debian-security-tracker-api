	"id": "CVE-2023-1428",
	"description": "There exists an vulnerability causing an abort() to be called in gRPC.  The following headers cause gRPC's C++ implementation to abort() when called via http2:  te: x (x != trailers)  :scheme: x (x != http, https)  grpclb_client_stats: x (x == anything)  On top of sending one of those headers, a later header must be sent that gets the total header size past 8KB. We recommend upgrading past git commit 2485fa94bd8a723e5c977d55a3ce10b301b437f8 or v1.53 and above.",
