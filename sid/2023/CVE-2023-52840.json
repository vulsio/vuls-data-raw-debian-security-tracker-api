	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Input: synaptics-rmi4 - fix use after free in rmi_unregister_function()  The put_device() calls rmi_release_function() which frees \"fn\" so the dereference on the next line \"fn->num_of_irqs\" is a use after free. Move the put_device() to the end to fix this.",
