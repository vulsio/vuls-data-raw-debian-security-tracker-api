	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: core: Run atomic i2c xfer when !preemptible  Since bae1d3a05a8b, i2c transfers are non-atomic if preemption is disabled. However, non-atomic i2c transfers require preemption (e.g. in wait_for_completion() while waiting for the DMA).  panic() calls preempt_disable_notrace() before calling emergency_restart(). Therefore, if an i2c device is used for the restart, the xfer should be atomic. This avoids warnings like:  [   12.667612] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:318 rcu_note_context_switch+0x33c/0x6b0 [   12.676926] Voluntary context switch within RCU read-side critical section! ...
