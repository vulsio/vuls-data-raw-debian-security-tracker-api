	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  samples/bpf: syscall_tp_user: Fix array out-of-bound access  Commit 06744f24696e (\"samples/bpf: Add openat2() enter/exit tracepoint to syscall_tp sample\") added two more eBPF programs to support the openat2() syscall. However, it did not increase the size of the array that holds the corresponding bpf_links. This leads to an out-of-bound access on that array in the bpf_object__for_each_program loop and could corrupt other variables on the stack. On our testing QEMU, it corrupts the map1_fds array and causes the sample to fail:    # ./syscall_tp   prog #0: map ids 4 5   verify map:4 val: 5   map_lookup failed: Bad file descriptor  Dynamically allocate the array based on the number of programs reported by libbpf to prevent similar inconsistencies in the future",
