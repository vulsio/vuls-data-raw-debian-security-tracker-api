	"id": "CVE-2023-27371",
	"description": "GNU libmicrohttpd before 0.9.76 allows remote DoS (Denial of Service) due to improper parsing of a multipart/form-data boundary in the postprocessor.c MHD_create_post_processor() method. This allows an attacker to remotely send a malicious HTTP POST packet that includes one or more '\\0' bytes in a multipart/form-data boundary field, which - assuming a specific heap layout - will result in an out-of-bounds read and a crash in the find_boundary() function.",
