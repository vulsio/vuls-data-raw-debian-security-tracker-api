While browsing entries LDAP tries to decode the userPassword attribute instead of the userCertificate attribute which could lead into sensitive information leaked. An attacker with a local account where the cockpit-389-ds is running can list the processes and display the hashed passwords. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
