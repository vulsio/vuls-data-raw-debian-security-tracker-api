	"id": "CVE-2023-47627",
	"description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.",
