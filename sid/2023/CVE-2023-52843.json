	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  llc: verify mac len before reading mac header  LLC reads the mac header with eth_hdr without verifying that the skb has an Ethernet header.  Syzbot was able to enter llc_rcv on a tun device. Tun can insert packets without mac len and with user configurable skb->protocol (passing a tun_pi header when not configuring IFF_NO_PI).

There are further uses in include/net/llc_pdu.h. All these are protected by a test skb->protocol == ETH_P_802_2. Which does not protect against this tun scenario.  But the mac_len test added in this patch in llc_fixup_skb will indirectly protect those too. That is called from llc_rcv before any other LLC code.  It is tempting to just add a blanket mac_len check in llc_rcv, but not sure whether that could break valid LLC paths that do not assume an Ethernet header. 802.2 LLC may be used on top of non-802.3 protocols in principle. The below referenced commit shows that used to, on top of Token Ring.  At least one of the three eth_hdr uses goes back to before the start of git history. But the one that syzbot exercises is introduced in this commit. That commit is old enough (2008), that effectively all stable kernels should receive this.",
