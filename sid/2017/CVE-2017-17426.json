	"id": "CVE-2017-17426",
	"description": "The malloc function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.26 could return a memory block that is too small if an attempt is made to allocate an object whose size is close to SIZE_MAX, potentially leading to a subsequent heap overflow. This occurs because the per-thread cache (aka tcache) feature enables a code path that lacks an integer overflow check.",
