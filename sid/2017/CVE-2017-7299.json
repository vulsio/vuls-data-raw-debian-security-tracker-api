	"id": "CVE-2017-7299",
	"description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, has an invalid read (of size 8) because the code to emit relocs (bfd_elf_final_link function in bfd/elflink.c) does not check the format of the input file before trying to read the ELF reloc section header. The vulnerability leads to a GNU linker (ld) program crash.",
