	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/fbdev-dma: Only set smem_start is enable per module option  Only export struct fb_info.fix.smem_start if that is required by the user and the memory does not come from vmalloc().  Setting struct fb_info.fix.smem_start breaks systems where DMA memory is backed by vmalloc address space. An example error is shown below.

Resolve this by checking the module flag drm_leak_fbdev_smem when DRM allocated the instance of struct fb_info. Fbdev-dma then only sets smem_start only if required (via FBINFO_HIDE_SMEM_START). Also guarantee that the framebuffer is not located in vmalloc address space.",
