	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: list_lru: fix UAF for memory cgroup  The mem_cgroup_from_slab_obj() is supposed to be called under rcu lock or cgroup_mutex or others which could prevent returned memcg from being freed.  Fix it by adding missing rcu read lock.  Found by code inspection.
