	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fs: don't try and remove empty rbtree node  When copying a namespace we won't have added the new copy into the namespace rbtree until after the copy succeeded. Calling free_mnt_ns() will try to remove the copy from the rbtree which is invalid. Simply free the namespace skeleton directly.",
