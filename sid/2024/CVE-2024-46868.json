	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()  If the __qcuefi pointer is not set, then in the original code, we would hold onto the lock.  That means that if we tried to set it later, then it would cause a deadlock.  Drop the lock on the error path.  That's what all the callers are expecting.",
