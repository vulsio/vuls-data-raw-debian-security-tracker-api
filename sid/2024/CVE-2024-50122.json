	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: Hold rescan lock while adding devices during host probe  Since adding the PCI power control code, we may end up with a race between the pwrctl platform device rescanning the bus and host controller probe functions. The latter need to take the rescan lock when adding devices or we may end up in an undefined state having two incompletely added devices and hit the following crash when trying to remove the device over sysfs:    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000   Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] SMP   Call trace:     __pi_strlen+0x14/0x150     kernfs_find_ns+0x80/0x13c     kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0x54/0xf0     sysfs_remove_bin_file+0x24/0x34     pci_remove_resource_files+0x3c/0x84     pci_remove_sysfs_dev_files+0x28/0x38     pci_stop_bus_device+0x8c/0xd8     pci_stop_bus_device+0x40/0xd8     pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device_locked+0x28/0x48     remove_store+0x70/0xb0     dev_attr_store+0x20/0x38     sysfs_kf_write+0x58/0x78     kernfs_fop_write_iter+0xe8/0x184     vfs_write+0x2dc/0x308     ksys_write+0x7c/0xec",
