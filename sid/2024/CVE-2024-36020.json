	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i40e: fix vf may be used uninitialized in this function warning  To fix the regression introduced by commit 52424f974bc5, which causes servers hang in very hard to reproduce conditions with resets races. Using two sources for the information is the root cause. In this function before the fix bumping v didn't mean bumping vf pointer. But the code used this variables interchangeably, so stale vf could point to different/not intended vf.  Remove redundant \"v\" variable and iterate via single VF pointer across whole function instead to guarantee VF pointer validity.",
