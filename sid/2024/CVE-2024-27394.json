	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tcp: Fix Use-After-Free in tcp_ao_connect_init  Since call_rcu, which is called in the hlist_for_each_entry_rcu traversal of tcp_ao_connect_init, is not part of the RCU read critical section, it is possible that the RCU grace period will pass during the traversal and the key will be free.  To prevent this, it should be changed to hlist_for_each_entry_safe.",
