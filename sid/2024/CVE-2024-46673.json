	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: aacraid: Fix double-free on probe failure  aac_probe_one() calls hardware-specific init functions through the aac_driver_ident::init pointer, all of which eventually call down to aac_init_adapter().  If aac_init_adapter() fails after allocating memory for aac_dev::queues, it frees the memory but does not clear that member.  After the hardware-specific init function returns an error, aac_probe_one() goes down an error path that frees the memory pointed to by aac_dev::queues, resulting.in a double-free.",
