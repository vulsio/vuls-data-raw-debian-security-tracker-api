	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdkfd: Check debug trap enable before write dbg_ev_file  In interrupt context, write dbg_ev_file will be run by work queue. It will cause write dbg_ev_file execution after debug_trap_disable, which will cause NULL pointer access. v2: cancel work \"debug_event_workarea\" before set dbg_ev_file as NULL.",
