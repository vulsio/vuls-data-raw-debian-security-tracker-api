	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ima: Fix use-after-free on a dentry's dname.name  ->d_name.name can change on rename and the earlier value can be freed; there are conditions sufficient to stabilize it (->d_lock on dentry, ->d_lock on its parent, ->i_rwsem exclusive on the parent's inode, rename_lock), but none of those are met at any of the sites. Take a stable snapshot of the name instead.",
