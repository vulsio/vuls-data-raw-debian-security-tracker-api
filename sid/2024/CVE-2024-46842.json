	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: lpfc: Handle mailbox timeouts in lpfc_get_sfp_info  The MBX_TIMEOUT return code is not handled in lpfc_get_sfp_info and the routine unconditionally frees submitted mailbox commands regardless of return status.  The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware returns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region references previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.  Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox resource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not timeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources because it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later time in its cmpl routine.  Also, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot scripts requiring longer timeouts.",
