	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinctrl: nuvoton: fix a double free in ma35_pinctrl_dt_node_to_map_func()  'new_map' is allocated using devm_* which takes care of freeing the allocated data on device removal, call to  \t.dt_free_map = pinconf_generic_dt_free_map  double frees the map as pinconf_generic_dt_free_map() calls pinctrl_utils_free_map().  Fix this by using kcalloc() instead of auto-managed devm_kcalloc().",
