	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix OOB in nilfs_set_de_type  The size of the nilfs_type_by_mode array in the fs/nilfs2/dir.c file is defined as \"S_IFMT >> S_SHIFT\", but the nilfs_set_de_type() function, which uses this array, specifies the index to read from the array in the same way as \"(mode & S_IFMT) >> S_SHIFT\".  static void nilfs_set_de_type(struct nilfs_dir_entry *de, struct inode  *inode) { \tumode_t mode = inode->i_mode;  \tde->file_type = nilfs_type_by_mode[(mode & S_IFMT)>>S_SHIFT]; // oob }  However, when the index is determined this way, an out-of-bounds (OOB) error occurs by referring to an index that is 1 larger than the array size when the condition \"mode & S_IFMT == S_IFMT\" is satisfied.  Therefore, a patch to resize the nilfs_type_by_mode array should be applied to prevent OOB errors.",
