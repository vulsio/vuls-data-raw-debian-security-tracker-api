	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  libfs: fix get_stashed_dentry()  get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry from a provided location.  It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues.  Use rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() it's effectively equivalent with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that this expects rcu protection.",
