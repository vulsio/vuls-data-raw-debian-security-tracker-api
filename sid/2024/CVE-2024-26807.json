	"id": "CVE-2024-26807",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: cadence-qspi: fix pointer reference in runtime PM hooks  dev_get_drvdata() gets used to acquire the pointer to cqspi and the SPI controller. Neither embed the other; this lead to memory corruption.  On a given platform (Mobileye EyeQ5) the memory corruption is hidden inside cqspi->f_pdata. Also, this uninitialised memory is used as a mutex (ctlr->bus_lock_mutex) by spi_controller_suspend().",
