	"description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in the qtdemux_merge_sample_table function within qtdemux.c. The problem is that the size of the stts buffer isnâ€™t properly checked before reading stts_duration, allowing the program to read 4 bytes beyond the boundaries of stts->data. This vulnerability reads up to 4 bytes past the allocated bounds of the stts array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
