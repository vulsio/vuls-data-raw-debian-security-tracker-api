	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfs/blocklayout: Don't attempt unregister for invalid block device  Since commit d869da91cccb (\"nfs/blocklayout: Fix premature PR key unregistration\") an unmount of a pNFS SCSI layout-enabled NFS may dereference a NULL block_device in:    bl_unregister_scsi+0x16/0xe0 [blocklayoutdriver]   bl_free_device+0x70/0x80 [blocklayoutdriver]   bl_free_deviceid_node+0x12/0x30 [blocklayoutdriver]   nfs4_put_deviceid_node+0x60/0xc0 [nfsv4]   nfs4_deviceid_purge_client+0x132/0x190 [nfsv4]   unset_pnfs_layoutdriver+0x59/0x60 [nfsv4]   nfs4_destroy_server+0x36/0x70 [nfsv4]   nfs_free_server+0x23/0xe0 [nfs]   deactivate_locked_super+0x30/0xb0   cleanup_mnt+0xba/0x150   task_work_run+0x59/0x90   syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x217/0x220   do_syscall_64+0x8e/0x160  This happens because even though we were able to create the nfs4_deviceid_node, the lookup for the device was unable to attach the block device to the pnfs_block_dev.  If we never found a block device to register, we can avoid this case with the PNFS_BDEV_REGISTERED flag.  Move the deref behind the test for the flag.",
