	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: check return value of sock_recvmsg when draining clc data  When receiving clc msg, the field length in smc_clc_msg_hdr indicates the length of msg should be received from network and the value should not be fully trusted as it is from the network. Once the value of length exceeds the value of buflen in function smc_clc_wait_msg it may run into deadloop when trying to drain the remaining data exceeding buflen.  This patch checks the return value of sock_recvmsg when draining data in case of deadloop in draining.",
