	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ocfs2: cancel dqi_sync_work before freeing oinfo  ocfs2_global_read_info() will initialize and schedule dqi_sync_work at the end, if error occurs after successfully reading global quota, it will trigger the following warning with CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_* enabled:  ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: 00000000d8b0ce28 object type: timer_list hint: qsync_work_fn+0x0/0x16c  This reports that there is an active delayed work when freeing oinfo in error handling, so cancel dqi_sync_work first.  BTW, return status instead of -1 when .read_file_info fails.",
