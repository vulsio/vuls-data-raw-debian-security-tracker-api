Therefore, fix the out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()` by accessing only seven positions on the '__u32 [7]' array. The eighth register exists indeed on V3D 7.1, but it isn't currently used. That being so, let's guarantee that it remains unused and add a note that it could be set in a future patch.",
