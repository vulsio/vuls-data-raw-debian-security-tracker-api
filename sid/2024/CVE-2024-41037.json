	"id": "CVE-2024-41037",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entry  When system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF core calls hw_params_upon_resume(). On Intel platforms with HDA DMA used to manage the link DMA, this leads to call chain of     hda_dsp_set_hw_params_upon_resume()  -> hda_dsp_dais_suspend()  -> hda_dai_suspend()  -> hda_ipc4_post_trigger()  A bug is hit in hda_dai_suspend() as hda_link_dma_cleanup() is run first, which clears hext_stream->link_substream, and then hda_ipc4_post_trigger() is called with a NULL snd_pcm_substream pointer.",
