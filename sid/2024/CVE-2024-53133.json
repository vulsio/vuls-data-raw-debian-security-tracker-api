	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Handle dml allocation failure to avoid crash  [Why] In the case where a dml allocation fails for any reason, the current state's dml contexts would no longer be valid. Then subsequent calls dc_state_copy_internal would shallow copy invalid memory and if the new state was released, a double free would occur.  [How] Reset dml pointers in new_state to NULL and avoid invalid pointer  (cherry picked from commit bcafdc61529a48f6f06355d78eb41b3aeda5296c)",
