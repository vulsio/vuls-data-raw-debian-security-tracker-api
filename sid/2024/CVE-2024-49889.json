	"id": "CVE-2024-49889",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: avoid use-after-free in ext4_ext_show_leaf()  In ext4_find_extent(), path may be freed by error or be reallocated, so using a previously saved *ppath may have been freed and thus may trigger use-after-free, as follows:  ext4_split_extent   path = *ppath;   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)   path = ext4_find_extent(ppath)   ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)     // ext4_find_extent fails to free path     // but zeroout succeeds   ext4_ext_show_leaf(inode, path)     eh = path[depth].p_hdr     // path use-after-free !!!  Similar to ext4_split_extent_at(), we use *ppath directly as an input to ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.  Same problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since 'path' is only used in ext4_ext_show_leaf(), remove 'path' and use *ppath directly.  This issue is triggered only when EXT_DEBUG is defined and therefore does not affect functionality.",
