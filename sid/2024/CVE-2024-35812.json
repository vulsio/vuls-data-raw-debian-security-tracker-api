	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: cdc-wdm: close race between read and workqueue  wdm_read() cannot race with itself. However, in service_outstanding_interrupt() it can race with the workqueue, which can be triggered by error handling.  Hence we need to make sure that the WDM_RESPONDING flag is not just only set but tested.",
