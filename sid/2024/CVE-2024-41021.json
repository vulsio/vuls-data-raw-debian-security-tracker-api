	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()  There is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on s390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in do_exception().  However, since commit af19487f00f3 (\"mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more general\"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with PTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON otherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().  Fix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar to x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault flags, for easier debugging.  Note that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot support swap entries on other levels than PTE level.",
