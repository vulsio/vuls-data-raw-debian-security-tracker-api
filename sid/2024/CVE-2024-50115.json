	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory  Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits 4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.  In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.  Per the APM:    The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer   table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,   with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.  And the SDM's much more explicit:    4:0    Ignored  Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow that is broken.",
