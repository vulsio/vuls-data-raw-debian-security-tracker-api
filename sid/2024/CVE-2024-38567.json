	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: carl9170: add a proper sanity check for endpoints  Syzkaller reports [1] hitting a warning which is caused by presence of a wrong endpoint type at the URB sumbitting stage. While there was a check for a specific 4th endpoint, since it can switch types between bulk and interrupt, other endpoints are trusted implicitly. Similar warning is triggered in a couple of other syzbot issues [2].  Fix the issue by doing a comprehensive check of all endpoints taking into account difference between high- and full-speed configuration.  [1] Syzkaller report: ...
