	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()  Since tomoyo_write_control() updates head->write_buf when write() of long lines is requested, we need to fetch head->write_buf after head->io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can cause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.",
