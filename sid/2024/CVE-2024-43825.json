	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table  The sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended. It could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.  Here are more details:  1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time sequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do out-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value `new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be moved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold. Meanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without termination and out-of-bound write. 2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements will just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment \"Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates\".
