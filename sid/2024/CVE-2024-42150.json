	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: txgbe: remove separate irq request for MSI and INTx  When using MSI or INTx interrupts, request_irq() for pdev->irq will conflict with request_threaded_irq() for txgbe->misc.irq, to cause system crash. So remove txgbe_request_irq() for MSI/INTx case, and rename txgbe_request_msix_irqs() since it only request for queue irqs.  Add wx->misc_irq_domain to determine whether the driver creates an IRQ domain and threaded request the IRQs.",
