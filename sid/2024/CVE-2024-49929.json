	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereference  iwl_mvm_tx_skb_sta() and iwl_mvm_tx_mpdu() verify that the mvmvsta pointer is not NULL. It retrieves this pointer using iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211, which is dereferencing the ieee80211_sta pointer. If sta is NULL, iwl_mvm_sta_from_mac80211 will dereference a NULL pointer. Fix this by checking the sta pointer before retrieving the mvmsta from it. If sta is not NULL, then mvmsta isn't either.",
