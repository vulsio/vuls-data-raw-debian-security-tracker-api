	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add null check in resource_log_pipe_topology_update  [WHY] When switching from \"Extend\" to \"Second Display Only\" we sometimes call resource_get_otg_master_for_stream on a stream for the eDP, which is disconnected. This leads to a null pointer dereference.  [HOW] Added a null check in dc_resource.c/resource_log_pipe_topology_update.",
