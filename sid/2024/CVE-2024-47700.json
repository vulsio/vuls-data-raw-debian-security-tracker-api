	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: check stripe size compatibility on remount as well  We disable stripe size in __ext4_fill_super if it is not a multiple of the cluster ratio however this check is missed when trying to remount. This can leave us with cases where stripe < cluster_ratio after remount:set making EXT4_B2C(sbi->s_stripe) become 0 that can cause some unforeseen bugs like divide by 0.  Fix that by adding the check in remount path as well.",
