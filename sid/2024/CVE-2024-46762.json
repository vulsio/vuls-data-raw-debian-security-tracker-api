	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance  Nothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls to privcmd_irqfd_assign() and privcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that a kirqfd created and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may get removed by another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while the former is still using it after dropping the locks.  This can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance may be accessed and cause kernel oops.  Use SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the KVM implementation for irqfds.",
