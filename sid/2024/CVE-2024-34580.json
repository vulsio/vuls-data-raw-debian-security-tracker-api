	"id": "CVE-2024-34580",
	"description": "Apache XML Security for C++ through 2.0.4 implements the XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) specification without protection against an SSRF payload in a KeyInfo element. NOTE: the project disputes this CVE Record on the grounds that any vulnerabilities are the result of a failure to configure XML Security for C++ securely. Even when avoiding this particular issue, any use of this library would need considerable additional code and a deep understanding of the standards and protocols involved to arrive at a secure implementation for any particular use case. We recommend against continued direct use of this library.",
