	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/bnxt_re: Avoid CPU lockups due fifo occupancy check loop  Driver waits indefinitely for the fifo occupancy to go below a threshold as soon as the pacing interrupt is received. This can cause soft lockup on one of the processors, if the rate of DB is very high.  Add a loop count for FPGA and exit the __wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_th if the loop is taking more time. Pacing will be continuing until the occupancy is below the threshold. This is ensured by the checks in bnxt_re_pacing_timer_exp and further scheduling the work for pacing based on the fifo occupancy.",
