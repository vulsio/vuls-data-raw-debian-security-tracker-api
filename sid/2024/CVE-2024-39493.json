	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  crypto: qat - Fix ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC memory leak  Using completion_done to determine whether the caller has gone away only works after a complete call.  Furthermore it's still possible that the caller has not yet called wait_for_completion, resulting in another potential UAF.  Fix this by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing the memory safely.",
