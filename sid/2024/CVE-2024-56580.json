	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: qcom: camss: fix error path on configuration of power domains  There is a chance to meet runtime issues during configuration of CAMSS power domains, because on the error path dev_pm_domain_detach() is unexpectedly called with NULL or error pointer.  One of the simplest ways to reproduce the problem is to probe CAMSS driver before registration of CAMSS power domains, for instance if a platform CAMCC driver is simply not built.  Warning backtrace example:      Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000001a2      <snip>      pc : dev_pm_domain_detach+0x8/0x48     lr : camss_probe+0x374/0x9c0      <snip>      Call trace:      dev_pm_domain_detach+0x8/0x48      platform_probe+0x70/0xf0      really_probe+0xc4/0x2a8      __driver_probe_device+0x80/0x140      driver_probe_device+0x48/0x170      __device_attach_driver+0xc0/0x148      bus_for_each_drv+0x88/0xf0      __device_attach+0xb0/0x1c0      device_initial_probe+0x1c/0x30      bus_probe_device+0xb4/0xc0      deferred_probe_work_func+0x90/0xd0      process_one_work+0x164/0x3e0      worker_thread+0x310/0x420      kthread+0x120/0x130      ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20",
