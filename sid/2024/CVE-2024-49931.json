	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: ath12k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats  Currently, the ath12k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error array is defined with a maximum size of DP_REO_DST_RING_MAX. However, the ath12k_dp_rx_process() function access ath12k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error using the REO destination SRNG ring ID, which is incorrect. SRNG ring ID differ from normal ring ID, and this usage leads to out-of-bounds array access. To fix this issue, modify ath12k_dp_rx_process() to use the normal ring ID directly instead of the SRNG ring ID to avoid out-of-bounds array access.  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
