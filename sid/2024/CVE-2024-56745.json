	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: Fix reset_method_store() memory leak  In reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assigned to the local \"options\". options is then used in with strsep() to find spaces:    while ((name = strsep(&options, \" \")) != NULL) {  If there are no remaining spaces, then options is set to NULL by strsep(), so the subsequent kfree(options) doesn't free the memory allocated via kstrndup().  Fix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options is preserved.",
