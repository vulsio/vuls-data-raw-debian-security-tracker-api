	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on error  The error handling path in its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double free when its_vpe_init() fails after successfully allocating at least one interrupt. This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the interrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page and its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and the vprop_page again.  Fix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() which handles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeing from its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().
