	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/xen: don't do PV iret hypercall through hypercall page  Instead of jumping to the Xen hypercall page for doing the iret hypercall, directly code the required sequence in xen-asm.S.  This is done in preparation of no longer using hypercall page at all, as it has shown to cause problems with speculation mitigations.  This is part of XSA-466 / CVE-2024-53241.",
