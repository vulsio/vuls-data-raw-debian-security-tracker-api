	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined  In iocg_pay_debt(), warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which is intended to confirm iocg is active when it has debt. However, warn can be triggered during a blkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn() is run at that time:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402 iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190   Call trace:   iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190   iocg_kick_waitq+0x438/0x4c0   iocg_waitq_timer_fn+0xd8/0x130   __run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c   __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244   hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0  The warn in this situation is meaningless. Since this iocg is being removed, the state of the 'active_list' is irrelevant, and 'waitq_timer' is canceled after removing 'active_list' in ioc_pd_free(), which ensures iocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn() returns.  Therefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoid warn when removing a blkcg or disk.",
