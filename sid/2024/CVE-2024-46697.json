	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfsd: ensure that nfsd4_fattr_args.context is zeroed out  If nfsd4_encode_fattr4 ends up doing a \"goto out\" before we get to checking for the security label, then args.context will be set to uninitialized junk on the stack, which we'll then try to free. Initialize it early.",
