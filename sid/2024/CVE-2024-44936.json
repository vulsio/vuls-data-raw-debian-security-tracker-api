	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  power: supply: rt5033: Bring back i2c_set_clientdata  Commit 3a93da231c12 (\"power: supply: rt5033: Use devm_power_supply_register() helper\") reworked the driver to use devm. While at it, the i2c_set_clientdata was dropped along with the remove callback. Unfortunately other parts of the driver also rely on i2c clientdata so this causes kernel oops.  Bring the call back to fix the driver.",
