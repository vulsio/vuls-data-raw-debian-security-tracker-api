	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/dasd: fix double module refcount decrement  Once the discipline is associated with the device, deleting the device takes care of decrementing the module's refcount.  Doing it manually on this error path causes refcount to artificially decrease on each error while it should just stay the same.",
