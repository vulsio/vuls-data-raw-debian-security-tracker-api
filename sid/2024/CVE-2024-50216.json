	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfs: fix finding a last resort AG in xfs_filestream_pick_ag  When the main loop in xfs_filestream_pick_ag fails to find a suitable AG it tries to just pick the online AG.  But the loop for that uses args->pag as loop iterator while the later code expects pag to be set.  Fix this by reusing the max_pag case for this last resort, and also add a check for impossible case of no AG just to make sure that the uninitialized pag doesn't even escape in theory.",
