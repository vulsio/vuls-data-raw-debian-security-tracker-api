	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  Revert \"ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event in process context\"  Commit 7ba5ca32fe6e (\"ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event in process context\") removed the process context workqueue from amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer() and update_pcm_pointers() to remove its overhead.  With RME Fireface 800, this lead to a regression since Kernels 5.14.0, causing an AB/BA deadlock competition for the substream lock with eventual system freeze under ALSA operation:  thread 0:     * (lock A) acquire substream lock by \tsnd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in \tsnd_pcm_status64()     * (lock B) wait for tasklet to finish by calling     \ttasklet_unlock_spin_wait() in \ttasklet_disable_in_atomic() in \tohci_flush_iso_completions() of ohci.c  thread 1:     * (lock B) enter tasklet     * (lock A) attempt to acquire substream lock,     \twaiting for it to be released: \tsnd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in     \tsnd_pcm_period_elapsed() in \tupdate_pcm_pointers() in \tprocess_ctx_payloads() in \tprocess_rx_packets() of amdtp-stream.c  ? tasklet_unlock_spin_wait  </NMI>  <TASK> ohci_flush_iso_completions firewire_ohci amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer snd_firewire_lib snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 snd_pcm snd_pcm_status64 snd_pcm  ? native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath  </NMI>  <IRQ> _raw_spin_lock_irqsave snd_pcm_period_elapsed snd_pcm process_rx_packets snd_firewire_lib irq_target_callback snd_firewire_lib handle_it_packet firewire_ohci context_tasklet firewire_ohci  Restore the process context work queue to prevent deadlock AB/BA deadlock competition for ALSA substream lock of snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in snd_pcm_status64() and snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in snd_pcm_period_elapsed().  revert commit 7ba5ca32fe6e (\"ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event in process context\")  Replace inline description to prevent future deadlock.",
