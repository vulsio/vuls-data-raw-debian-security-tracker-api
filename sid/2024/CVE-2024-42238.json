	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  firmware: cs_dsp: Return error if block header overflows file  Return an error from cs_dsp_power_up() if a block header is longer than the amount of data left in the file.  The previous code in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_load_coeff() would loop while there was enough data left in the file for a valid region. This protected against overrunning the end of the file data, but it didn't abort the file processing with an error.",
