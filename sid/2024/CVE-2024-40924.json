	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/i915/dpt: Make DPT object unshrinkable  In some scenarios, the DPT object gets shrunk but the actual framebuffer did not and thus its still there on the DPT's vm->bound_list. Then it tries to rewrite the PTEs via a stale CPU mapping. This causes panic.  [vsyrjala: Add TODO comment] (cherry picked from commit 51064d471c53dcc8eddd2333c3f1c1d9131ba36c)",
