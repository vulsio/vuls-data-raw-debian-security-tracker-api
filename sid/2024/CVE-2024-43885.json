	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: fix double inode unlock for direct IO sync writes  If we do a direct IO sync write, at btrfs_sync_file(), and we need to skip inode logging or we get an error starting a transaction or an error when flushing delalloc, we end up unlocking the inode when we shouldn't under the 'out_release_extents' label, and then unlock it again at btrfs_direct_write().  Fix that by checking if we have to skip inode unlocking under that label.",
