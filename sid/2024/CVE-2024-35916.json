	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dma-buf: Fix NULL pointer dereference in sanitycheck()  If due to a memory allocation failure mock_chain() returns NULL, it is passed to dma_fence_enable_sw_signaling() resulting in NULL pointer dereference there.  Call dma_fence_enable_sw_signaling() only if mock_chain() succeeds.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
