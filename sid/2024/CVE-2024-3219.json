	"id": "CVE-2024-3219",
	"description": "The  “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to the  socket.socketpair() function for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX,  such as Windows. This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET or  AF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection  between the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets  back to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to a  connection race from a malicious local peer.  Platforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by this vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included.",
