	"id": "CVE-2024-12088",
	"description": "A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links` option, the rsync client fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination sent from the server contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the desired directory.",
