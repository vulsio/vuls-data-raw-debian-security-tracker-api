	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/iucv: Avoid explicit cpumask var allocation on stack  For CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y kernel, explicit allocation of cpumask variable on stack is not recommended since it can cause potential stack overflow.  Instead, kernel code should always use *cpumask_var API(s) to allocate cpumask var in config-neutral way, leaving allocation strategy to CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK.  Use *cpumask_var API(s) to address it.",
