	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  NFSD: Prevent a potential integer overflow  If the tag length is >= U32_MAX - 3 then the \"length + 4\" addition can result in an integer overflow. Address this by splitting the decoding into several steps so that decode_cb_compound4res() does not have to perform arithmetic on the unsafe length value.",
