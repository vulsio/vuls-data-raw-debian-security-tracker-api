	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix access to uninitialised lock in fc replay path  The following kernel trace can be triggered with fstest generic/629 when executed against a filesystem with fast-commit feature enabled:  INFO: trying to register non-static key. The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe you didn't initialize this object before use? turning off the locking correctness validator.

In the replay path there's an attempt to lock sbi->s_bdev_wb_lock in function ext4_check_bdev_write_error().  Unfortunately, at this point this spinlock has not been initialized yet.  Moving it's initialization to an earlier point in __ext4_fill_super() fixes this splat.",
