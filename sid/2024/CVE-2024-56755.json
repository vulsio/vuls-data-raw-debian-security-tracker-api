	"id": "CVE-2024-56755",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING  In fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between the bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a situation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been detected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as follows:    [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work] fscache_perform_lookup   fscache_create_volume                         fscache_perform_lookup                           fscache_create_volume \t\t\t                        fscache_create_volume_work                                                   cachefiles_acquire_volume                                                   clear_and_wake_up_bit     test_and_set_bit                             test_and_set_bit                               goto maybe_wait       goto no_wait  In the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1 enters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting process. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the -wait- process indefinitely.  In commit 3288666c7256 (\"fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in fscache_create_volume_work()\"), barriers were added to similar operations in fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.  By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to fix this issue.",
