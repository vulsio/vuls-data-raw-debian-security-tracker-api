	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/swapfile: skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma  I got a bad pud error and lost a 1GB HugeTLB when calling swapoff.  The problem can be reproduced by the following steps:   1. Allocate an anonymous 1GB HugeTLB and some other anonymous memory.  2. Swapout the above anonymous memory.  3. run swapoff and we will get a bad pud error in kernel message:    mm/pgtable-generic.c:42: bad pud 00000000743d215d(84000001400000e7)  We can tell that pud_clear_bad is called by pud_none_or_clear_bad in unuse_pud_range() by ftrace.  And therefore the HugeTLB pages will never be freed because we lost it from page table.  We can skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma to fix it.",
