	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  media: v4l: async: Fix NULL pointer dereference in adding ancillary links  In v4l2_async_create_ancillary_links(), ancillary links are created for lens and flash sub-devices. These are sub-device to sub-device links and if the async notifier is related to a V4L2 device, the source sub-device of the ancillary link is NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. Check the notifier's sd field is non-NULL in v4l2_async_create_ancillary_links().  [Sakari Ailus: Reword the subject and commit messages slightly.]",
