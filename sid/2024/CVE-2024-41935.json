	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: fix to shrink read extent node in batches  We use rwlock to protect core structure data of extent tree during its shrink, however, if there is a huge number of extent nodes in extent tree, during shrink of extent tree, it may hold rwlock for a very long time, which may trigger kernel hang issue.  This patch fixes to shrink read extent node in batches, so that, critical region of the rwlock can be shrunk to avoid its extreme long time hold.",
