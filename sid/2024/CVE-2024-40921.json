	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: bridge: mst: pass vlan group directly to br_mst_vlan_set_state  Pass the already obtained vlan group pointer to br_mst_vlan_set_state() instead of dereferencing it again. Each caller has already correctly dereferenced it for their context. This change is required for the following suspicious RCU dereference fix. No functional changes intended.",
