	"id": "CVE-2024-42233",
	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  filemap: replace pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock()  The vmf->ptl in filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none() is still set from handle_pte_fault().  But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf->pte).  After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table may be racily changed and vmf->ptl maybe fails to protect the actual page table.  Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock().  As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF.  Also, if the PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 (\"filemap: avoid unnecessary major faults in filemap_fault()\") might reappear.",
