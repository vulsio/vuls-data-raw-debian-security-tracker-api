	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: amdgpu_ttm_gart_bind set gtt bound flag  Otherwise after the GTT bo is released, the GTT and gart space is freed but amdgpu_ttm_backend_unbind will not clear the gart page table entry and leave valid mapping entry pointing to the stale system page. Then if GPU access the gart address mistakely, it will read undefined value instead page fault, harder to debug and reproduce the real issue.",
