	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ipv6: mcast: remove one synchronize_net() barrier in ipv6_mc_down()  As discussed in the past (commit 2d3916f31891 (\"ipv6: fix skb drops in igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()\")) I think the synchronize_net() call in ipv6_mc_down() is not needed.  Under load, synchronize_net() can last between 200 usec and 5 ms.  KASAN seems to agree as well.",
