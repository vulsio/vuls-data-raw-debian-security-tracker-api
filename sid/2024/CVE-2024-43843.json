	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv, bpf: Fix out-of-bounds issue when preparing trampoline image  We get the size of the trampoline image during the dry run phase and allocate memory based on that size. The allocated image will then be populated with instructions during the real patch phase. But after commit 26ef208c209a (\"bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size\"), the `im` argument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This may cause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructions when generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-bounds issues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the \"im\" address during dry run to fix this problem.",
