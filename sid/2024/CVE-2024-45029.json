	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe  On ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a mutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:  \tBUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585 \t...  \tCall trace: \t__might_sleep \t__mutex_lock_common \tmutex_lock_nested \tacpi_subsys_runtime_resume \trpm_resume \ttegra_i2c_xfer  The problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock &dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later, rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies on mutexes, triggering the error.  To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe, considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.",
