	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netkit: Assign missing bpf_net_context  During the introduction of struct bpf_net_context handling for XDP-redirect, the netkit driver has been missed, which also requires it because NETKIT_REDIRECT invokes skb_do_redirect() which is accessing the per-CPU variables. Otherwise we see the following crash:  \tBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000038 \tbpf_redirect() \tnetkit_xmit() \tdev_hard_start_xmit()  Set the bpf_net_context before invoking netkit_xmit() program within the netkit driver.",
