	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix potential invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partition  The blk_add_partition() function initially used a single if-condition (IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This was modified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the function to proceed without logging the error in this case. However, this change unintentionally left a path where md_autodetect_dev() could be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.  This commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the initial if-condition, improving code readability and handling specific error scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes the general error case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of md_autodetect_dev() calls.",
