	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt  In rxe_comp_queue_pkt() an incoming response packet skb is enqueued to the resp_pkts queue and then a decision is made whether to run the completer task inline or schedule it. Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw' performance counter. This is wrong because if the completer task is already running in a separate thread it may have already processed the skb and freed it which can cause a seg fault.  This has been observed infrequently in testing at high scale.  This patch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet until after the counter is accessed.",
