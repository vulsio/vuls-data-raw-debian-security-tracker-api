	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort path  The commit mutex should not be released during the critical section between nft_gc_seq_begin() and nft_gc_seq_end(), otherwise, async GC worker could collect expired objects and get the released commit lock within the same GC sequence.  nf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex to load module dependencies, then it goes back to replay the transaction again. Move it at the end of the abort phase after nft_gc_seq_end() is called.",
