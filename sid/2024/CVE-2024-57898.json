	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up  Currently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from the valid_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, some functions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One such example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -  nl80211_remove_link()     cfg80211_remove_link()         ieee80211_del_intf_link()             ieee80211_vif_set_links()                 ieee80211_vif_update_links()                     ieee80211_link_stop()                         cfg80211_cac_event()  cfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared already in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.  Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link clean-up.",
