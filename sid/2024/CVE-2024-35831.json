	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: Fix release of pinned pages when __io_uaddr_map fails  Looking at the error path of __io_uaddr_map, if we fail after pinning the pages for any reasons, ret will be set to -EINVAL and the error handler won't properly release the pinned pages.  I didn't manage to trigger it without forcing a failure, but it can happen in real life when memory is heavily fragmented.",
