	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rxe: Fix responder length checking for UD request packets  According to the IBA specification: If a UD request packet is detected with an invalid length, the request shall be an invalid request and it shall be silently dropped by the responder. The responder then waits for a new request packet.  commit 689c5421bfe0 (\"RDMA/rxe: Fix incorrect responder length checking\") defers responder length check for UD QPs in function `copy_data`. But it introduces a regression issue for UD QPs.  When the packet size is too large to fit in the receive buffer. `copy_data` will return error code -EINVAL. Then `send_data_in` will return RESPST_ERR_MALFORMED_WQE. UD QP will transfer into ERROR state.",
