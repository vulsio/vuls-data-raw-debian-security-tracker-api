	"id": "CVE-2015-8709",
	"description": "kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4.1 mishandles uid and gid mappings, which allows local users to gain privileges by establishing a user namespace, waiting for a root process to enter that namespace with an unsafe uid or gid, and then using the ptrace system call.  NOTE: the vendor states \"there is no kernel bug here.",
