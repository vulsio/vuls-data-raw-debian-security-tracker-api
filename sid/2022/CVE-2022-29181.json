	"id": "CVE-2022-29181",
	"description": "Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for Ruby. Nokogiri prior to version 1.13.6 does not type-check all inputs into the XML and HTML4 SAX parsers, allowing specially crafted untrusted inputs to cause illegal memory access errors (segfault) or reads from unrelated memory. Version 1.13.6 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, ensure the untrusted input is a `String` by calling `#to_s` or equivalent.",
