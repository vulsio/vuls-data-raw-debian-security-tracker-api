	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sfc: fix TX channel offset when using legacy interrupts  In legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, but that's not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case, the offset is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channel at index 0, together with the rx queue.  Without this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, it tries to get the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540 efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]   [...]   RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]   [...]   Call Trace:    <IRQ>    dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230    sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360    __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40   [...]   BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020   [...]   RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]   [...]   Call Trace:    <IRQ>    dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230    sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360    __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40   [...]",
