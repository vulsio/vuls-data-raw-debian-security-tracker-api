	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block: fix memory leak in disk_register_independent_access_ranges  kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails. According to the doc of kobject_init_and_add()     If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to    properly clean up the memory associated with the object.  Fix this issue by adding kobject_put(). Callback function blk_ia_ranges_sysfs_release() in kobject_put() can handle the pointer \"iars\" properly.",
