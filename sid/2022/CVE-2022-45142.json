	"description": "The fix for CVE-2022-3437 included changing memcmp to be constant time and a workaround for a compiler bug by adding \"!= 0\" comparisons to the result of memcmp. When these patches were backported to the heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches) a logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity codes in gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.",
