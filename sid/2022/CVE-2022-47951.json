	"description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder before 19.1.2, 20.x before 20.0.2, and 21.0.0; Glance before 23.0.1, 24.x before 24.1.1, and 25.0.0; and Nova before 24.1.2, 25.x before 25.0.2, and 26.0.0. By supplying a specially created VMDK flat image that references a specific backing file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of that file's contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.",
