	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  vt_ioctl: fix array_index_nospec in vt_setactivate  array_index_nospec ensures that an out-of-bounds value is set to zero on the transient path. Decreasing the value by one afterwards causes a transient integer underflow. vsa.console should be decreased first and then sanitized with array_index_nospec.
