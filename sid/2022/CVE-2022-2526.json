	"id": "CVE-2022-2526",
	"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs due to the on_stream_io() function and dns_stream_complete() function in 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing the reference counting for the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and callbacks called can dereference the DNSStream object, causing the use-after-free when the reference is still used later.",
