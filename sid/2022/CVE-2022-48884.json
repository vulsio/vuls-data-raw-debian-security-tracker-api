	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Fix command stats access after free  Command may fail while driver is reloading and can't accept FW commands till command interface is reinitialized. Such command failure is being logged to command stats. This results in NULL pointer access as command stats structure is being freed and reallocated during mlx5 devlink reload (see kernel log below).  Fix it by making command stats statically allocated on driver probe.
