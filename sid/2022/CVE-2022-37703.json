	"description": "In Amanda 3.5.1, an information leak vulnerability was found in the calcsize SUID binary. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to know if a directory exists or not anywhere in the fs. The binary will use `opendir()` as root directly without checking the path, letting the attacker provide an arbitrary path.",
