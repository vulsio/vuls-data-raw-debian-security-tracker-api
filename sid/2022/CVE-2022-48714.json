	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Use VM_MAP instead of VM_ALLOC for ringbuf  After commit 2fd3fb0be1d1 (\"kasan, vmalloc: unpoison VM_ALLOC pages after mapping\"), non-VM_ALLOC mappings will be marked as accessible in __get_vm_area_node() when KASAN is enabled. But now the flag for ringbuf area is VM_ALLOC, so KASAN will complain out-of-bound access after vmap() returns. Because the ringbuf area is created by mapping allocated pages, so use VM_MAP instead.  After the change, info in /proc/vmallocinfo also changes from   [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmalloc user to   [start]-[end]   24576 ringbuf_map_alloc+0x171/0x290 vmap user",
