	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free race condition for maps  It is possible that in between calling fastrpc_map_get() until map->fl->lock is taken in fastrpc_free_map(), another thread can call fastrpc_map_lookup() and get a reference to a map that is about to be deleted.  Rewrite fastrpc_map_get() to only increase the reference count of a map if it's non-zero. Propagate this to callers so they can know if a map is about to be deleted.  Fixes this warning: refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free. WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 10100 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate ...
