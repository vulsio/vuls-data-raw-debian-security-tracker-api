	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/virtio: Fix GEM handle creation UAF  Userspace can guess the handle value and try to race GEM object creation with handle close, resulting in a use-after-free if we dereference the object after dropping the handle's reference.  For that reason, dropping the handle's reference must be done *after* we are done dereferencing the object.",
