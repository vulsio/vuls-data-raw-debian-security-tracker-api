	"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts  When IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uring instance A to uring instance B, where A and B use different MMs for accounting, the accounting can go wrong: If uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memory counters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinned memory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM of uring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.",
